      "====================\n",
      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to revise the original indication for the patient's CT Urogram based on the provided clinical notes. The original indication is \"urothelial carcinoma.\" Let me start by going through the clinical notes to gather relevant information.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I see that the patient is a male with a history of bladder cancer. There's a mention of a cystoscopy procedure where the diagnosis was bladder cancer, and they're doing follow-up. The clinical history includes bladder cancer and mentions that the patient is undergoing surveillance cystoscopy. The relevant symptoms include some posterior wall erythema, and there are lab results showing negative urine analysis, which is important for the diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the original indication, it's quite brief, just \"urothelial carcinoma.\" The task is to revise this into a concise indication that includes relevant details. The user's sample shows that the revised indication includes the diagnosis, procedure, and follow-up plan, all in one sentence. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I need to incorporate the fact that the patient has a history of bladder cancer, the procedure done (cystoscopy), and the reason for the CT Urogram, which is follow-up after bladder cancer resection. Additionally, the lab results showing negative urine analysis might be relevant, but perhaps it's more about the procedure itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, the revised indication should mention the diagnosis of bladder cancer, the follow-up cystoscopy, and the need for the CT Urogram to assess for recurrence or progression. It should be concise, within 10 words if possible, but since the sample used 10 words, I think it's acceptable to go slightly over if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the revised indication would be something like: \"Bladder cancer follow-up after resection, s/p cystoscopy with negative urine analysis.\" But wait, the sample used \"Bladder cancer resection s/p, follow-up CT urogram for recurrence.\" That's 10 words, so maybe I can make it similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, I can structure it as: \"CT urogram for follow-up of bladder cancer resection, s/p cystoscopy with negative urine analysis.\" But that might be a bit long. The sample seems to focus more on the procedure and the reason, so perhaps focusing on the follow-up and the purpose is better.\n",
