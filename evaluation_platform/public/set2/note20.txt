LUNG TR SAC - Progress Notes (Physician) | 2022-09-09 00:00:00
ID: ***** ***** is a 85 y.o. male who underwent a lung transplantation on 01/21/2009 for pulmonary fibrosis who presents for follow up.    CC:   Chief Complaint   Patient presents with    Post Lung Transplant Follow-up     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ***** *****  is being seen in follow up in the UCSF Lung Transplant Program today for follow up of lung transplantation.    He comes in today for follow up and has had a challenging 6 months.  He has multiple overlapping symptoms which were somewhat difficult to dissect.  Most importantly he has been feeling fatigued, sleepy, occasionally dizzy over the last few weeks.  He has not noted chest pain but has had more shortness of breath than prior baseline. He never returned to baseline since his admission this *****.  He had some mild improvement following cardioversion for his atrial arrythmia - but this improvement was short.    He had melena in July - and was admitted for observation and colonoscopy - which showed diverticulosis. Anticoagulation has been discontinued.  He is on tamsulosin which he says is a new medication started for hesitancy, frequency, urgency.  He has also been taking a regular dose of bumex 1mg daily.  In June he had a cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.   He is off the eliquis now and he remains on *****.    He has more shortness of breath than prior baseline. He reported some congestion and was recently given a course of antibiotics by his PCP.  He has had no culture (sputum) nor viral swab.  He has no active viral symptoms - no nasal congestion, runny nose. He has an occasional cough which he thinks "rattles" but no significant mucus.  Other complaints today:  His wife thinks that he isn't thinking as clearly - he has a harder time remembering names.  He continues to have intermittent shortness of breath.  He has mild drop in oxygen saturation.  He has desaturations with sleeping. He had a overnight sleep study.  He was trialed on a 
 CPAP machine.  He is using oxygen at night - 2 liters/minute - and this appears to resolve desaturation    Overall the swelling in his legs is better - but still pretty tight.  He thinks they are better.

Stable parenchymal scar.    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN   ***** ***** is a 85 y.o. male who underwent a lung transplantation on 01/21/2009 for pulmonary fibrosis who presents for follow up.    FATIGUE/UNSTEADINESS  This may be related to Tamsulosin which was started shortly before these symptoms started.  I have advised him to hold this drug for a week to see if his symptoms improve  He had a sleep study which was reportedly positive - but we do not have the report.  He is not on treatment. I have advised that if he does have sleep apnea then some of his symptoms may be related to untreated OSA.  I have 
 asked him to monitor his blood pressure and pulse.  He does not appear volume deplete today but this is a possibility given his daily diuretic - continue to monitor closely.    LUNG TRANSPLANT:  The patient is currently 13 years and 7 months post transplant  The patient's Peak FEV1 post transplant is 2.84  He has CLAD after ***** infection. Lung function is currently worse today  We will obtain a CT scan of the chest given drop in lung function and symptoms  The patient has no DSA.  Continue aggressive follow up of graft function    S/P AVR 2016 and now TAVR.   Performed at ***** ***** *****. *****. 2016. Received #27 *****-***** valve.  Dr. ***** at ***** performed TAVR March 2022.  Dr. ***** is his local cardiologist    IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: I have discussed with the patient the need for ongoing immunosuppression, with its associated risks and benefits. I have made the following recommendations regarding his current immunosuppression regimen:   Continue Prednisone at 7.5 mg po daily  Prograf at 1 mg po qAM and 1 mg po QPM  Cellcept at 250 mg po bid  Labs for tacrolimus, CBC, electrolytes, BUN / Creat monthly.   Patient is on Azithromycin for BOS prophylaxis.     INFECTION PROPHYLAXIS   CMV Prophylaxis: Valcyte is held - continue to monitor PCR  Fungal Prophylaxis: none  PCP prophylaxis: Septra DS TIW     METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSION  Osteoporosis Prophylaxis: patient on high vitamin D doses.   Hypomagnesemia: not on treatment  Hypertension: only on lasix 40 mg daily  Hyperglycemia: see DM management  Lipitor: 10 mg daily.     LE EDEMA: - suspect venous insufficiency contributing to edema, but cannot exclude an alternative diagnosis.  Continue bumex 1mg daily  Continue cardiology follow up     Diabetes  Lantus and NovoLog flex pen sliding scale  Follow up with endocrinology.      Prior skin cancer  He will continue frequent follow up with dermatology  If skin cancers recur, we could consider 
 everolimus, but may be difficult given his other issues     Atrial fibrillation that is post ablation in March 2015  Patient underwent Amulet ***** closure 2018.  Recent cardioversion May 2022. Now on eliquis x 1 month and started on *****.   Continue to follow with cardiology  ***** be on lifelong aspirin    Patient Education and Counseling (check topics discussed with patient):  Medications  Diet Nutrition      We will plan to see the patient again according to our routine post lung transplant monitoring schedule unless other issues arise, in which case he has been instructed to call us at *****-*****-*****.     *****,      ***** *****, MD  Professor of Clinical Medicine  Medical Director, Advanced Lung Disease and Transplantation  UCSF Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy & Sleep Medicine  *****.*****@*****.*****    ***** spent a total of 45 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures.
