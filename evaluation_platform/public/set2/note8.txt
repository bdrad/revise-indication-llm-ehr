LUNG TR SAC - Patient Instructions (Physician) | 2022-11-11 00:00:00
Here is a brief summary of what we discussed today in the Lung Transplant Clinic:    Reduce the cellcept (mycophenolate) to 250mg once daily.  We have discussed the potential of starting everolimus as a substitute for mycophenolate given your skin cancer and your lung function being lower.  We will remeasure your function at your 14 year visit and make some decisions.  New prednisone prescription at ***** ***** *****.      Please check out our website: *****.*****.***** for educational videos about lung transplant from our caregivers and providers.      If you have any questions of problems before your next scheduled visit, please contact us at *****-*****-*****.
