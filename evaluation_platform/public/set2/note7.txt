LUNG TR SAC - Progress Notes (Physician) | 2022-11-11 00:00:00
ID: ***** ***** is a 85 y.o. male who underwent a lung transplantation on 01/21/2009 for pulmonary fibrosis who presents for follow up.    CC:   No chief complaint on file.    HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ***** *****  is being seen in follow up in the UCSF Lung Transplant Program today for follow up of lung transplantation.    I saw ***** 2 months ago and at that time he had severe fatigue and issues with edema.  He is doing much better since then. He is followed by local EP. He was found to be in atrial fibrillation - underwent a cardioversion - for atrial fibrillation.  His shortness of breath is better - and his exercise tolerance is better.  He reports the edema is much better - he has been monitoring his diet - which has helped his blood sugars and edema. He continues to use bumex 1mg daily.    He currently has a ***** device and has continued aflutter. He is being considered to have another cardioversion - but will plan pre-procedure TEE to rule out clot.    He has a skin cancer on his lower lip - and will see high risk dermatology and planning an mohs surgery on November 26.    He had melena in July - and was admitted for observation and colonoscopy - which showed diverticulosis. Anticoagulation has been discontinued.  He continues to have intermittent shortness of breath.  He has mild drop in oxygen saturation.  He has desaturations with sleeping. He had a overnight sleep study.  He was trialed on a CPAP machine.  He is using oxygen at night - 2 liters/minute - and this appears to resolve desaturation    The following portions of the patient's history were reviewed by a provider in this encounter and updated as appropriate:         PMH:   Past Medical History:   Diagnosis Date    Acute bronchitis due to Rhinovirus July 2009    Allergic state     Arthritis     Atrial fibrillation (CMS code)     perioperative, s/p ablation (March 2015)    Bronchial stenosis     Hyperlipidemia     Hypothyroidism     Idiopathic

Stable parenchymal scar.    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN   ***** ***** is a 85 y.o. male who underwent a lung transplantation on 01/21/2009 for pulmonary fibrosis who presents for follow up.    FATIGUE/UNSTEADINESS  This is much better - he thinks since a cardioversion.  He had held the tamsulosin for a few days and this did not seem to impact his dizziness.  He is back on this therapy.  He had a sleep study which was reportedly positive - but we do not have the report.  He is not on treatment. I have advised that if he does have sleep apnea then some of his symptoms may be related to untreated OSA.  I have asked him to monitor his blood pressure and pulse.  He does not appear volume deplete today but this is a possibility given his daily diuretic - continue to monitor closely.    Atrial fibrillation that is post ablation in March 2015  It is recurrent - and now reportedly Atrial Flutter (regular on exam).  Patient underwent Amulet ***** closure 2018.  Recent 
 cardioversion May 2022 and again October 13. Continues on *****. He is off anticoagulation  Continue to follow with cardiology - considered for cardioversion for flutter.  ***** be on lifelong aspirin  He is currently off of xarelto - he has a *****.  He is being scheduled for a cardioversion.    LUNG TRANSPLANT:  The patient is currently 13 years and 9 months post transplant  The patient's Peak FEV1 post transplant is 2.84  He has CLAD after ***** infection. Lung function is stable today  The patient has no DSA.  Continue aggressive follow up of graft function    S/P AVR 2016 and now TAVR.   Performed at ***** ***** *****. *****. 2016. Received #27 *****-***** valve.  Dr. ***** at ***** performed TAVR March 2022.  Dr. ***** is his local cardiologist.  Dr. ***** is the new EP physician (*****)    IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: I have discussed with the patient the need for ongoing immunosuppression, with its associated risks and benefits. I have made the following recommendations regarding his current immunosuppression regimen:   Continue Prednisone at 7.5 mg po daily  Prograf at 1 mg po qAM and 1 mg po QPM - level is OK at 5.8  Cellcept at 250 mg po bid - reduce to once daily due to skin cancer.  We have considered mTOR but given cardiac issues  / edema we will hold off.   Labs for tacrolimus, CBC, electrolytes, BUN / Creat monthly.   Patient is on Azithromycin for BOS prophylaxis.     INFECTION PROPHYLAXIS   CMV Prophylaxis: Valcyte is held - continue to monitor PCR  Fungal Prophylaxis: none  PCP prophylaxis: Septra DS TIW     METABOLIC COMPLICATIONS OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSION  Osteoporosis Prophylaxis: patient on high vitamin D doses.   Hypomagnesemia: not on treatment  Hypertension: only on lasix 40 mg daily  Hyperglycemia: see DM management  Lipitor: 10 mg daily.     LE EDEMA: - suspect venous insufficiency contributing to edema, but cannot exclude an alternative diagnosis.  Continue bumex 1mg daily  Continue cardiology 
 follow up     Diabetes  Lantus and NovoLog flex pen sliding scale  Follow up with endocrinology.      Prior skin cancer  He will continue frequent follow up with dermatology  If skin cancers recur, we could consider everolimus, but may be difficult given his other issues     Patient Education and Counseling (check topics discussed with patient):  Medications  Diet Nutrition      We will plan to see the patient again according to our routine post lung transplant monitoring schedule unless other issues arise, in which case he has been instructed to call us at *****-*****-*****.     *****,      ***** *****, MD  Professor of Clinical Medicine  Medical Director, Advanced Lung Disease and Transplantation  UCSF Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Allergy & Sleep Medicine  *****.*****@*****.*****    ***** spent a total of 50 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.
