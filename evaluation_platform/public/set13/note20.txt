Per ID would like to have biopsy of these collections to know if it is active ***** infection vs post pancreatitis changes, and there is a concern that the aortitis is a result of extension from the fluid collections.

Per ID on May 17, after discussion with National Jewish (experts in ***** infections), either a source control issue vs poor absorption either of which could be occurring in this patient given her low therapeutic drug levels and ongoing possible fluid collections.
