She is ***** not interested in other surgeries given the pain and risk associated, which is reasonable given that her disease progressed despite aggressive source control and the likelihood of cure is still very low. She emphasizes wanting both comfort (not being in pain) as well as time, for which we feel continuing IV therapy for ***** will accomplish this goal, despite the risks of med *****. Once stable on ***** ***** meds- would be suitable likely for dispo to MZ.   - Cont IV therapy for *****  - Optimize pain as below    # Disseminated *****, worsening  # Aortitis   # Peripancreatic fluid collection:    Has had a complicated course with ***** treatment and some difficulty with outpatient treatment regimen.As an inpatient continues to have difficulty gaining control of infection.Has known dissemination to lungs, spine, *****, abdominal aorta, has cleared blood stream of infection. She has documented + ***** cultures in several sites including her blood, sputum, spine and skin. See ID notes/results 
 review for full summary of positive cultures to date. More recently developed aortitis and peripancreatic fluid collections based on CT findings on May 14 while in the ICU. Per ID would like to have biopsy of these collections to know if it is active ***** infection vs post pancreatitis changes, and there is a concern that the aortitis is a result of extension from the fluid collections. Vascular surgery has evaluated the aortitis and recommend serial imaging. Overall, patient with very difficult to treat ***** despite several weeks of inpatient treatment and it is unclear why she has been having treatment failure. Per ID on May 17, after discussion with National Jewish (experts in ***** infections), either a source control issue vs poor absorption either of which could be occurring in this patient given her low therapeutic drug levels and ongoing possible fluid collections. Less likely resistance. Globally with her evidence of progressive disease she likely has incurable disease and after GOC conversation today (see ACP note May 20), she is not interested in further surgery for aggressive source control measures for which we will continue aggressive management in the form of IV therapy as she has a goal to have more time with her family and friends.
