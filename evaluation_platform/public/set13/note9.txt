Goals of Care conversation regarding patient's long term course with ***** and options for treatment going forward    Participants:   Primary Team: ***** *****  Transplant ID Team: Drs. ***** and *****  Patient  Patient's DPOA: ***** *****  Multiple patient family members on video     We provided an update on the patient's long term course with ***** and progression of disease despite aggressive medical and surgical management. Even despite our best efforts to control and eradicate her infection (if we were to continue with all aggressive treatments) we are not confident we would be able to cure her disease. We discussed several possible options for treatment going forward from most to least aggressive  1. Most aggressive: recommending ***** for ***** control (and that is assuming she would be suitable candidate which we wonder about based on frailty) + ongoing iV therapies   Discussed risks of therapies (med toxicities plus risk of surgery including post-op pain) would likely outweigh benefit/chance of cure    2. Ongoing IV abx - risk of med ***** but would likely slow progression of disease.     3. ***** to oral only therapy - less risk of ***** but would not slow disease as much as IV regimen (likely)    4. No further treatment    She emphasized 2 key goals: not being in pain (and ***** not having any further procedures) and having more time to live. She is willing to accept the risk of med toxicities at the expense of living longer.For this, we recommended ongoing IV abx + more aggressive pain control but no further surgeries or aggressive diagnostics (serial imaging, etc)    She understands that she is dying from her infection and wants to live the rest of her life in the hospital. She does not have a place of living where she would feel comfortable having ongoing treatment and ***** the care of providers in the hospital.     We do not know her prognosis as this time given recent changes of IV 
 therapies for ***** which may give more time, however it is likely on the order of months given how quickly her disease has already progressed (for a typically indolent infection). She continuously mentioned wanting "about another month", just to have more time, there is no specific date she is hoping to live to ***** goals to accomplish during this time.    Other medical complications may come up over this time such as AKI even requiring RRT (not discussed today) due to med toxicities. We also did not discuss her code status but feel this is appropriate to address given her aortitis with not ***** risk of sudden decompensation    follow up needs:  - code status conversation  - pain med optimization, monitoring for other symptoms (anxiety, etc)  - cont IV med mgmt of ***** per ID
