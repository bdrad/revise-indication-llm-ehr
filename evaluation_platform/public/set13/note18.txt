Compared to 04/29/2022, increased size of multiple peripancreatic collections, for example the peripancreatic just inferior to the pancreatic tail measures 2 5.2 cm (October 74), previously 4.4 cm.   2. Status post T7-12 posterior spinal fusion and T9 laminectomy with expected stranding/fluid within the paraspinal soft tissues, no discrete fluid collections (please see separate chest CT report for additional findings). No acute postsurgical hardware complications.   3. Right lower quadrant renal allograft with patent transplant vasculature, and without hydronephrosis.     CT Chest May 15  1. Status post T7-12 posterior spinal fusion and T9 laminectomy with expected stranding/fluid within the paraspinal soft tissues. 1.8 cm rim-enhancing fluid collection within the right paraspinal soft tissues at the level of T4-5 (series 3, image 57) which appears to communicate with the surgical bed inferiorly.   2. No acute postsurgical hardware complications.   3. Right upper lobe groundglass opacities which may reflect focal infectious/inflammatory change versus pulmonary edema.   4. Bibasilar linear atelectasis. Trace bilateral pleural effusions.     CTH ***** May 15:  No evidence of acute intracranial abnormality. Specifically, no acute intracranial hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or herniation.     TTE March 14:  1. The left ventricular volume is normal. LV function is hyperdynamic. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 70 to 75%. There is inadequate image quality for accurate estimation of left ventricular mass. No segmental wall motion abnormalities present.   There is a mid cavity LV gradient noted. There is a gradient of 13 mmHg noted at rest.  2. The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular 
 function is normal.  3. Left atrial size is normal. The right atrium is not well seen.  4. There is mild to moderate aortic stenosis. Based on an LVOT diameter of 1.9 cm, an AV VTI of 44 cm and a LVOT VTI of 24 cm, the aortic valve area is 1.5 cm. The peak aortic ***** is 2.8 m/s. The peak aortic valve gradient is 30 mmHg and the mean   gradient is 17 mmHg.  5. Tachycardia precludes the accurate evaluation of diastolic function.  6. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure cannot be determined due to the lack of a complete ***** jet.  7. No pericardial effusion noted. The inferior vena cava is less than 21 mm in diameter and collapses with inspiration consistent with a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  8. Aortic root dimension is normal.

Peak CMV PCR of 1760 as of September 01, most recently down to 340 and then 150. Although she had diarrhea, the biopsy specimen obtained at the time of flexible sigmoidoscopy was negative for CMV.     She has been on treatment dose of Valcyte since September 02. Can discontinue in clinic once CMV PCR is undetectable.        Complains of low back pain 09/04/2021     Unclear etiology    MRI spine August 20   Multifocal endplate edema and enhancement including at the inferior endplate of L2, inferior endplate of T9, and 
 superior endplates of T11 and T12. Diffusely heterogeneous marrow signal.  Multilevel degenerative disc disease throughout the cervical and lumbar spine characterized by disc height loss and small disc bulges. Mild bilateral foraminal narrowing at L5-S1 on the basis of disc bulge and facet arthropathy. Paraspinal soft tissues: Focal ***** enhancement at L4-L5. No other suspicious paraspinal enhancement. Other: Approximately 11 mm peripherally enhancing fluid collection in the right psoas muscle (series 22 image 33). Atrophic bilateral native kidneys. Partially imaged right lower quadrant renal transplant. Findings of pancreatitis better evaluated on ***** ***** ***** chest.    IMPRESSION:   1.  Approximately 11 mm rim-enhancing fluid collection in the right psoas muscle, which is suspicious for a small psoas abscess. Otherwise no convincing evidence of spinal infection.    - Repeat MRI September 09- R psoas fluid collection resolved, decreased nonspecific endplate edema/enhancement, similar nonspecific mild interspinous edema in L spine - previously discussed with ortho spine, who reported BM enhancement is abnormal but nonsurgical and advised discuss with ID and oncology. Have discussed with both and thought to be nonspecific and not warranting further workup        Status post cholecystectomy 08/18/2021     Found to have multiorgan failure due to acute interstitial edematous pancreatitis, likely secondary to gallstones.   Recovering well. She is now s/p cholecystectomy on 09/14/2021    Complications  -Acute encephalopathy - resolved. This was also c/b hypercalcemia and delirium.  -Acute hypoxemic hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support - resolved.

August 13 CT head - Partially empty sella, unchanged from 2008. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, herniation, or hydrocephalus.  August 18 CT head - unremarkable    MRI brain August 20 -   1.  Reduced diffusion in the central pons compatible with an acute small vessel infarct versus osmotic demyelination. Questionable additional punctate focus of reduced diffusion in the right orbitofrontal cortex versus artifact.  2.  No abnormal intracranial enhancement or other evidence of intracranial infection.    Neurology on board  - EEG August 25 negative for seizure  - negative ammonia, HIV, RPR.

Donor was a 37 year old with GSW to the head. Immediate graft function, however post-operative course was complicated by a urine leak requiring retroperitoneal exploration and revision of ureterocystostomy on 02/28/12.
