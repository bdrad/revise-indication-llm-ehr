Radiology   Ultrasound Musculoskeletal (Joint/Tendon/Muscle)    Result Date: 05/20/2022  Heterogeneous, hypoechoic, vascular 
 collection/mass about the glenohumeral joint. The internal vascularity can be seen with marked synovitis; however, the appearance is atypical for a simple joint effusion. This corresponds with a multilocular, hypervascular shoulder effusion/collection seen on ***** ***** chest 05/15/2022. Differential includes infection i.e. septic arthritis or ***** mass. Recommend further evaluation with a dedicated MRI of the shoulder with contrast. Report dictated by: ***** ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** *****, MD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging     IR Rad Tunneled Line    Result Date: 05/21/2022  Insertion of right-sided dual-lumen tunneled ***** catheter, with tip in the expected location of the superior vena cava. At the conclusion of the case, the white port aspirated and flushed well. The red port flushed but had difficulty with aspiration. Technically challenging line placement due to high grade focal narrowing of the SVC. This is likely related to patient's history of multiple dialysis accesses. If central line placement is required in the future, would plan for ***** ***** to allow for angioplasty of the SVC if needed. Attestation ***** name: ***** *****, MD I attest that I was present for the entire procedure. I agree with the report as written. No unintentionally retained devices were noted upon review of the images.

 compression s/p fiducial screw placement April 29, spinal decompression April 30, possible infected AVF graft infection s/p removal May 03, and ICU stay for septic shock May 14, transferred to floor May 18 for ongoing care, now undergoing GOC discussions.      #GOC: ongoing discussions in light of patient's widely disseminated infection that has progressed despite multiple lines of treatment. See ACP note from May 20 ***** most recent discussion. Currently prioritizing comfort and time. However, will require further discussion regarding potential deescalation and/or full transition to comfort care as patient becomes more symptomatic from her progressive dz burden (particularly as patient appears to be suffering more from the perspective of pain and PO intolerance).   -Pall care ***** for assistance with GOC discussions and symptomatic care  -Code status updated to DNR/DNI   -***** need to clarify patient's wishes surrounding contingency planning re: enteral feeds, ICU transfer in upcoming days    #N/V, PO intolerance: progressive emesis, concerning for gut involvement related to ***** and possible compressive effects of peripancreatic fluid collections. ***** on endoscopic evaluation iso prior GOC discussions as above.  -Hold on enteral feeds (unclear benefit of postpyloric TFs given c/f extensive luminal involvement)  -Plan to start standing zofran 4 mg q8h, compazine 5 mg IV/PO q6h PRN if QTc is in acceptable range.     #Disseminated *****, worsening  #Aortitis   #Peripancreatic fluid collection:    Has had a complicated course with ***** treatment and some difficulty with outpatient treatment regimen, with e/o progressive infection despite multiple lines of therapy (*****+ cultures isolated from blood, sputum, spine, skin). See ID notes/results review for full summary of positive cultures to date. She unfortunately has more recent findings of aortitis and peripancreatic fluid collections on CT May 14. Per ID on May 17, 
 after discussion with National Jewish (experts in ***** infections), either a source control issue vs poor absorption either of which could be occurring in this patient given her low therapeutic drug levels and ongoing possible fluid collections. Less likely resistance. Globally with her evidence of progressive disease she likely has incurable disease, and have opted to defer further surgery or invasive diagnostic testing for source control. ***** cont with IV therapy with the goal of having more time with family and friends as the details are further delineated.   -Pall care consulted as above  Appreciate ID recs re management of *****:   -- Cont IV Azithromycin 500 mgat bedtime 12/2given concern for adequate absorption (Trough and peaks ***** ID, will order their recommendations  -- Rifamycin 600 *****   -- Ethambutol 800 mgat bedtime(Trough and peaks ***** ID, will order their recommendations   -- Amikacin 800 mg ***** (Trough and peaks ***** ID, will order their recommendations       --Started investigational agent clofazimine 100mg daily(IND #*****) on May 17    - Likely no further indication for imaging given her GOC, but if this were to change, the following biopsies/interventions/imaging would be considered the most aggressive medical care:  -Consider HPB to perform EUS guided biopsy on May 17 to evaluate pancreatic lesions for ***** as well as gastric biopsies to evaluate for gastric ***** invasion as possible cause of impaired absorption  - General surg consulted May 17, re surgical intervention for peripancreatic fluid collections (but not indicated given GOC)  - US R shoulder with c/f septic arthritis, would require washout  - IR consulted; no safe window for drain placement or aspiration of peripancreatic fluid collections   - Vascular surgery rec treating underlying infection and follow up CTA in 3-4 weeks, not likely surgical candidate but following for *****  -
