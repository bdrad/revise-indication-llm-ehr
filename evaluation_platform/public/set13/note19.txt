Postsurgical appearance status post post T7-12 posterior spinal fusion and T9 laminectomy with numerous regions of hypodense fluid of indeterminate sterility. Limited evaluation of spinal canal due to beam artifact.  2.  No acute postsurgical hardware complications.  3.  Increased right shoulder effusion, which may be seen in the setting of septic arthritis. Recommend ***** with physical exam.    CT A/P May 15  1.  Since 04/29/2022, mildly increased size of the peripancreatic collection adjacent to the pancreas tail, measuring 4.6 cm, previously 4.3 cm. 2.0 cm collection posterior to the splenic vein is slightly slightly. Additional smaller peripancreatic collections are unchanged.  2.  New soft tissue thickening and stranding surrounding the aorta at the level of the renal arteries raises concern for aortitis.  3.  Please refer to the separately dictated CT chest from the same evening, for description of the 
 thoracic spine postsurgical changes and instrumented posterior fusion extending from T7 to T12.    Back soft tissue U/S May 15:  1. Postsurgical soft tissue changes, no drainable fluid collection.    Assessment and Recommendations  ***** ***** ***** is 62 y.o. female with a history of DDRT in 2012 who has now had a several month course of aggressive disseminated ***** infection who's disease appears to progress despite 3 drug therapy, now s/p intensification of her regimen with IV amikacin/clofazimine/IV Rifampin.    Sites of involvement:  ***** (confirmed)  Skin (confirmed)  Vertebral osteomyelitis (confirmed)  Lung (confirmed)  AV graft   Bone marrow (granulomata on bx)  Peripancreatic collection (suspected)  Aortitis (suspected)  Possible shoulder effusion     As before, her severity of disease is out of proportion to her transplant immunosuppression.  Immunology work-up thus far has been negative.  Somewhat *****, she has cleared her blood cultures, although she continues to have evidence of worsening intra-abdominal and periaortic disease.  Ideally, aggressive source control would be needed and it is unclear if we will be able to ***** the progression of her disease without doing so.     We had a family meeting with her today and she expressed a strong desire not to pursue additional source control procedures.  She is interested in extending her life to some degree and was agreeable to continuing this intensified antimicrobial regimen. We will focus on optimizing her drug dosing and the primary team is very attentive to her comfort.    We sent drug levels to ensure we are achieving adequate therapeutic concentrations.    Recommendations  Diagnostic  ? Follow-up AFB blood cultures from May 19  ? Follow-up amikacin, ethambutol, and azithromycin   ? Agree with repeat CTA ~ June 06 to assess progression of aortitis   Therapeutic  ? Antibiotics   ? Azithromycin 500 mg IV daily  ? Ethambutol 1200 mg PO 
 daily  ? Rifampin 600 mg IV daily   ? Amikacin 800 mg IV MWF, range for peak goal 35-45  ? Clofazimine 100mg daily (IND #*****)  ? Anticipate ***** the vancomycin and cefepime if she remains stable   ? Therapeutic drug monitoring:  ? obtain 2hr and 6hr amikacin levels   ? obtain 2hr and 6hr ethambutol level  ? Obtain 2hr and 6hr azithro levels    The case was discussed with the ID attending. We will continue to follow.
