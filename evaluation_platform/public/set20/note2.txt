As you recall, this 70 y.o. woman was referred for neurologic consultation at your request regarding paresthesias in the limbs and trunk, but sparing the face.      The patient first developed her current symptoms in 2002. A brain MRI in 2003 was normal. She was placed on an anti-depressant which made her sleepy and she stopped it. Symptoms recurred. She was placed eventually on Cymbalta, which again reduced the symptoms and she again gained weight.  She stopped Cymbalta two years ago and then symptoms recurred. The paraesthesias interfere with her sleep by keeping her awake and awakening her from sleep. Symptoms can occur in different patches.  Duration varies and she cannot say how long they last. There are no triggers or relieving factors.       She denies headache, diplopia, change in speech, change in memory, difficulty speaking, difficulty eating or swallowing, focal weakness, focal sensory impairment, limb incoordination, nocturia, urinary or stool incontinence.    Diagnostic studies for the symptoms have included the following: 1 T4 was 1.05 and TSH 0.64 (both normal) on 02/25/21 at *****. I have personally reviewed her lumbar spine MRI scan from 09/02/21.  There is no evidence for nerve root compression in the foramina or lateral recesses.  There is diffuse lumbar paraspinal muscle atrophy. There is no record of a prior EMG study.     Current medications are Synthroid .100mg , Cytomel 10 micrograms, and 
 Protonix.      The past medical history is notable for GERD.  There is no known history of blood transfusion or reaction to contrast dye. There is na history of abnormal reactions to Keflex. Family history is ***** for aq sister with multiple sclerosis.  Social history is notable for her remotely from home in ***** ***** the University of *****.  The patient does not smoke tobacco. She drinks two glasses of wine per day.       Review of Systems:   Patient endorses:   A complete review of systems was performed in the patient questionnaire and reviewed with the patient at today's visit; pertinent positives and negatives are noted below. She reports rare, brief episodes of vertigo. All other systems were reviewed and are negative.     On general physical examination, vital signs are normal and as entered above in APEX.  Neck is supple.  Cardiac examination is notable for a normal S1 and S2 without murmur.  There is no clubbing, cyanosis or edema in the legs.     On mental status examination, she is alert and oriented to time, place, and person.  Attention span is 7 forward.  Speech is normal.  She can repeat a phrase, name *****, ***** ***** questions. She recalls February 14 objects at five minutes. ***** are normal.      On cranial nerve examination, the fundi are normal and optic disks are flat. Extraocular movements are normal and without nystagmus. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Facial sensation is normal to pin and light touch bilaterally.  Facial appearance is symmetric and normal in strength. Hearing to finger rub is normal bilaterally. Uvula elevates in the midline. Trapezius muscle power is normal bilaterally. Tongue bulk and power are normal.    On motor examination, there is normal bulk and tone in the limbs. There is a postural tremor.  Power is normal at the deltoid, biceps, triceps, *****, APB, iliopsoas, quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, hip *****, hip *****, 
 *****, and toe flexor muscles bilaterally. Fast finger movements and foot taps are of normal rate and rhythm bilaterally. *****-to-nose and heel-knee-shin are normal bilaterally. Tandem gait is normal. Reflexes are 2+at the biceps, triceps, finger flexors, knees, and ankles bilaterally. Plantar responses are flexor.    On sensory examination, light touch and pin over the  hands and feet are normal bilaterally. Vibration and position sensation are normal at the great toes. There is no ***** sign.    In summary, this 70 y.o. woman has a z month/year history of y. Her general examination is normal. Her neurologic examination reveals no focal neurologic findings. Prior neuroimaging reportedly revealed .  I have personally reviewed the brain/cervical spine/ lumbar spine MRI scan showing .Prior EMG studies revealed...Other laboratory studies revealed .    The symptoms, signs, and test findings most likely localize the diagnosis to .   The three most likely etiologies on the differential diagnosis are .     There was a prolonged discussion regarding symptoms, signs, diagnosis, prognosis, and management-including alternatives for treatment. The patient will undergo z diagnostic studies and begin treating her symptoms by a combination of PT, medication, and . She will follow-up with her primary care physician in x months.    Thank you for referring this patient to UCSF.     Sincerely,      *****, MD  Resident/Fellow in Neurology.

There is no evidence for nerve root compression in the foramina or lateral recesses.  There is diffuse lumbar paraspinal muscle atrophy. There is no record of a prior EMG study.      Her family history is positive for sister with multiple sclerosis for 30 years. She reports having a brain MRI in 2003 or 2004 for paresthesias, but we do not have reports or images to review. She was told it was normal. She reported blurred vision on her questionnaire, but states this symptom was transient. She denies episodes of altered vision, power or coordination that lasted days-to-months and then resolved.     Current medications are Synthroid .100mg , Cytomel 10 micrograms, and Protonix.      The past medical history is notable for GERD.  There is no known history of blood transfusion or reaction to contrast dye. There is na history of abnormal reactions to Keflex. Family history is ***** for aq sister with multiple sclerosis. The patient does not smoke tobacco. She drinks two glasses of wine per day.       A complete review of systems was performed in the patient questionnaire and reviewed with the patient at today's visit; pertinent positives and negatives are noted below. She reports rare, brief episodes of vertigo. She reports diminished 
 hearing. Weight gain, and heat intolerance. All other systems were reviewed and are negative or as mentioned in the history of present illness.     On general physical examination, vital signs are normal and as entered above in APEX.  Neck is supple. There is no Lhermitte's sign. There is no clubbing, cyanosis or edema in the legs.     On mental status examination, she is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Attention, language, memory for historical events, and speech are normal.     On cranial nerve examination, the extraocular movements are normal and without nystagmus. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Facial sensation is normal to pin and light touch bilaterally.  Facial appearance is symmetric and normal in strength. Uvula elevates in the midline. Trapezius muscle power is normal bilaterally. Tongue bulk and power are normal.    On motor examination, there is normal bulk and tone in the limbs. There is a mild postural tremor in the hands. Power is normal at the deltoid, biceps, triceps, *****, APB, iliopsoas, quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, hip *****, hip *****, *****, and toe flexor muscles bilaterally. Fast finger movements and foot taps are of normal rate and rhythm bilaterally. *****-to-nose and heel-knee-shin are normal bilaterally. Tandem gait is normal. Reflexes are 2+at the biceps, triceps, finger flexors, knees, and ankles bilaterally.     On sensory examination, light touch and pin over the hands and feet are normal bilaterally. There is no ***** sign.    In summary, this 70 y.o. woman has a 19 year history of paresthesias which come and go over patches of the limbs and trunk.There was a discussion regarding symptoms, signs, diagnosis, prognosis, and management. The paresthesias have been responsive to neuropathic symptom medications, but she has experienced unacceptable side effects the have triggered medication discontinuation. *****, her 
 neurologic examination reveals no focal neurologic findings. ***** thyroid function tests have been normal. An incidental finding on her lumbar spine MR imaging is diffuse paraspinal muscle atrophy of unclear etiology. Given her sensory symptoms and positive family history of MS, I think she should undergo a brain MRI.  We should consider the performance of a CPK and EMG in the future.    She will follow-up with us after her brain MRI and with her primary care physician.    Thank you for referring this patient to UCSF.     *****,      ***** *****, MD  Professor of Neurology    Electronically signed by ***** ***** *****, MD on 11/19/2021, 5:35 PM
