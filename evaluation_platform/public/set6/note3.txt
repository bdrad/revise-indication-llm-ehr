Report  From 08/27/23  Compared to 05/27/23  Impression:   Relative to 05/27/2023, no evidence of disease progression. Unchanged residual masslike T2/FLAIR hyperintensity surrounding the right frontal resection cavity.     ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:    In summary, Mr. ***** is a 32 y.o. year old man with grade 2 oligodendroglioma who continues to do well in follow-up with stable imaging and nonfocal neurological examination.      IMAGING SCORE: 0  NEUROLOGICAL SCORE: 0  STEROID SCORE: 0  OVERALL TUMOR ASSESSMENT: 0    1. Grade 2 oligodendroglioma:  As such, we will continue to monitor him with interval imaging, and I will plan to see him back in approximately 4 months with a new MRI.      2.  Seizures:  He has had none since his surgery, and remains on Keppra 500 mg BID, which he is tolerating well.      Follow-up:  - 4 months for next MRI and appointment. This scan is critical because based on the results, a change in the management plan for the patient may need to be made especially if there is any 
 evidence to suggest tumor progression.    - All questions of ***** ***** and his family were answered to the best of my ability. They have our contact information and will call with further questions.
