MS WEILL - Progress Notes (Psychologist) | 2022-06-28 00:00:00
                      NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION REPORT    Cautionary Notice: This report contains sensitive confidential information that may be ***** by untrained individuals.  Any disclosure, copying, or distribution of the contents is strictly prohibited without permission of the patient.  Dr. ***** ***** should be contacted directly prior to the release of this report to the patient.    IDENTIFYING INFORMATION  Patient Name: ***** *****  *****: 07/03/2022  Report From: ***** *****, Ph.D.  Referred by: ***** *****, M.D.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  For questions, please contact Dr. ***** ***** via APeX or email (*****.*****@*****.*****)         REASON FOR REFERRAL: Ms. ***** is a 64-year-old right-handed female with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents for follow-up of a working diagnosis of autoimmune/inflammatory encephalitis followed by development of NPH s/p VPS.  She developed cognitive symptoms, ataxia, and multifocal dyskinesias in 2019 that partially responded to IV steroids, monthly IVIG, and maintenance azathioprine.  For these conditions, Ms. ***** is currently followed by Dr. ***** ***** (UCSF *****/***** Center). Due to significant cognitive impairment, Ms. ***** underwent a neuropsychological evaluation, conducted by the current examiner, in 2021; results indicated severe neurocognitive impairment (dementia), most prominently so with executive function.  For the purpose of tracking the trajectory of this impairment, Dr. ***** referred Ms. ***** for a repeat neuropsychological evaluation.       Note: For the purposes of this evaluation report, background information and medical history are not reviewed extensively.      PROCEDURES:   Clinical Interview  ***** Drawing Test  ***** ***** Test  Sentence Repetition subtest from the ***** Aphasia Battery - Revised (WAB-R)  Digit ***** and Coding ***** from 
 the *****-*****  Brief Test of Attention (*****)  ***** ***** ***** Test - Revised (*****-R, form 1)  ***** *****, ***** *****, and Color-***** Interference ***** from the *****-***** ***** Function System (D-*****)      BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:   Appearance: Well-groomed; appeared somewhat tired during this evaluation;  Mood: Neutral affect; NO SI  Behavior: somewhat *****; easy to redirect  Speech/Language: No obvious word-finding problems noted; oral comprehension was sufficient; speech was normal across all parameters  Test-Taking: Frustration tolerance and mental persistence were adequate; due to frontal-executive syndrome she required some encouragement to persist on certain procedures    Raw scores on all measures are converted into a standard score based on the application of appropriate normative corrections; all tests are corrected for age or age/gender or age/gender/education. Below is the interpretive or classification range for test performance.  Note, however, the clinical interpretation takes individual characteristics (i.e., cultural/linguistic factors, estimates of longstanding intellectual abilities) into consideration, since standardized normative information does not account for all such factors.        Interpretive range   Very *****: > 97th                            Low Average: 10th - 24th percentile         *****: 91st - 97th percentile             Borderline: 2nd - 9th percentile   High Average: 76th - 90th percentile     Impaired: <2nd percentile        Average: 25th - 75th percentile       SUMMARY OF TEST RESULTS AND IMPRESSIONS  Markedly abnormal neuropsychological profile, with scores falling in the Impaired range on several procedures, particularly tasks with more complex demands, such as tasks of working memory (e.g., only able to recite a ***** of 2 digits backward on digit span task), learning/memory, and executive function.  In addition, Ms. ***** evidenced 
 marked slowing on tasks of processing/psychomotor speed.  In contrast, more rudimentary cognitive functions and those less dependent on speed of thinking appeared relatively well preserved, such as basic auditory attention (Average range on the forward span condition from digit span task), sentence repetition (100% accuracy), visual confrontation naming (Low Average range), and visual-perceptual/spatial processing (Low Average range).      Regarding test-retest changes, a mild improvement was noted on various procedures, namely tasks of processing speed, confrontation naming, and verbal fluency.  Minimal improvement was noted on list-learning procedure and measures of executive function.  In addition, from a qualitative perspective, Ms. ***** presented as less prone to distractibility from external stimuli.          *****:  Major neurocognitive impairment, with redemonstration of prominent frontal-executive system dysfunction, slowing in processing speed, and difficulties with learning/memory.  Improvement on testing was, however, noted with language and basic attention; this mirrors the improvement on the MOCA as documented in *****. *****'s most recent note.    Repeat assessment as clinically indicated.      Thank you for your kind referral of the patient. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any additional questions (Dr. ***** *****, *****.*****@*****.*****).    ***** Fine, Ph.D.  ***** Neuropsychologist  Multiple Sclerosis Center  Department of Neurology, UCSF Medical Center  Licensed Clinical Psychologist (***** *****)    FOR BILLING  Diagnostic Code/s:  Autoimmune Encephalitis (*****.81); Dementia (*****.80)  Time Spent: 2 hours for report writing, and records review; 2 hours for test administration and scoring.
