History (with Chief Complaint)  64 y.o. female with PMH of autoimmune encephalitis, NPH s/p VP shunt placed August 2021, and autoimmune hepatitis who presented with a one-day history of AMS and inability to ambulate. All initial history gathered from patient's husband, as AMS on admit ***** pt's ability to participate in interview. On the evening prior to admission (February 11), pt was able to go on a walk with her husband and ate a lot of ***** popcorn - that evening, pt started having abdominal pain and didn't want to eat. On February 12 in the morning, patient was lethargic and wasn't able to get out of bed. ***** noted she was having issues ambulating as well. 1 episode of nbnb vomiting on 12/2 AM as well. Over the course of the day, patient became less interactive and had increasing difficulty ambulating - husband ultimately drove her to the UCSF ED. Notably, patient had hx of chronic back pain, which was affecting her ability to walk, so obtained spinal injections 2 weeks prior (usually gets them roughly once yearly) in L spine.     Hospital course identified as below, with acute gangrenous cholecystitis requiring lap cholecystectomy and washout (02/13/22). Patient was treated for both this infection and possible VP hunt exposure to purulence. Other acute and chronic medical issues were treated as identified below. Plan for IV abx through 02/26/22 (vanc/cefepime/flagyl)        Brief Hospital Course by Problem    64 y.o. female with PMH of autoimmune 
 encephalitis (dx 2019), NPH s/p VP shunt placed August 2021, and autoimmune hepatitis who presents with a one-day history of abdominal pain, AMS, and global weakness f/t/h sepsis April 14 acute cholecystitis with purulent drainage leading to VP shunt exposure, currently empirically being treated for VP shunt and cholecystitis infection with improvement. Now requiring aggressive rehabilitation and ongoing antibiotics through 02/26/2022 with placement in *****.    *****/p lap cholecystectomy and washout (02/13/22)  Complicated by VP shunt exposure to purulence  Presented w/ abdominal pain, AMS, and global weakness. Diagnosed w/ Sepsis w/ GI source. In *****, patient noted to have gangrenous cholecystitis and frank pus spilling into abdominal cavity, near ***** shunt. Pt underwent cholecystectomy and washout, but surgery was concerned for VP shunt exposure. There was also c/f encephalopathy possibly out of proportion to cholecystitis, and needs further *****, neurology, and I.D. evaluation. At this time, no c/f active VP shunt infection but empirically treating as there is little literature on these cases. Has been on broad-spectrum abx and will c/w this for 2 week course as per I.D. recommendations  Work-up  - CSF studies w/o pleocytosis or elevated protein  -- ***** pending at time of discharge      -- ***** pending at time of discharge, add-on February 15  -- IgG 1.3 (within reference) with 0.5 IgG index, oligoclonal bands negative in *****, cocci no fungal isolation after 1 week (specimen concentrated to increase yield), fungal cultures re-sent as add-on (pending at time of *****)  -- ***** NGTD  -- HSV and VZV PCRs neg      -- MRI brain w/ and w/o contrast final read: no features of intracranial infection; slight reduction in ventricular caliber  Consultants: Gen Surg, Neurosurgery, and ID   General Surgery: s/p lap cholecystectomy February 14 w/ Dr *****. advanced to reg diet: JP drain removed 
 February 19. Paged on day of discharge to schedule follow up appointment    Neurosurgery: not concerned for ongoing VP shunt infection; signed off. OP follow up referral placed   I.D.: work-up as per below, abx as below  Treatment  - Continue empiric coverage for both infections: Cefepime 2gm IV q8h, Flagyl 500mg IV q8h , and ***** ***** ***** (on day of discharge was ordered for vancomycin 1 g BID) total of 2 weeks (started February 14, end February 27)  - PICC line placed February 19    Vitamin D deficiency  Vit D level 16  - started cholecalciferol 1000 units daily 02/22/22 based on lab  - would benefit from ***** ***** level recheck on around mid May 2022    Encephalopathy, Resolved.   Deconditioning  Generalized Weakness   Initial concerns for CNS infection, given AMS with known VP shunt and recent lumbar steroid injection as outpatient, and the fact that while altered patient did not endorse abdominal pain. Evaluation of VP shunt revealed normal functioning and normal ventricular size. After initiation of antibiotics for cholecystitis +/- VP shunt infection, pt's mental status improved and workup/symptoms clearly localized to abdominal source. More likely infectious encephalopathy from acute cholecystitis. MRI brain not c/f intracranial infection.  - MRI brain w/ and w/o contrast final read: no features of intracranial infection; slight reduction in ventricular caliber  - management of cholecystitis + empiric VP shunt treatment as above   - delirium precautions  - SLP re-***** aspiration precautions   - PT recommended acute rehab; pt also needs IV antibiotics as above through February 27    Elevated BPs, HTN Urgency, resolved  - currently on 10 mg daily amlodipine given persistently elevated pressures w/o contributing symptoms like pain or nausea.  - increased Lisinopril to 10mg daily February 22 given ongoing high SBP in 130s-140s; consider uptitration in 1-2 weeks depending on BMP and pressures    Hypoxia, resolved  Noted 
 to require up to 5L oxygen at one point; pt without major pulmonary complaints. CXR w/ likely atelectasis - ***** this has been ongoing since presenting weakness. No major consolidate c/f infection. Blood gas with mild ***** alkalosis. Now improved w/ ongoing PT/OT/ respiratory measures   - CXR w/ atelectasis w low lung volumes earlier in admission  - c/w bedside I.S.; earlier benefited from ***** q12h standing (no longer ordered since on RA)  - now off oxygen and CPO    Undifferentiated Autoimmune Encephalitis (dx 2020  Autoimmune hepatitis  (dx 2007)  NAFLD  Diagnosed w/ Autoimmune Hepatitis + Thyroiditis in 2007. In 2020 she began to experience gradual cognitive decline after stopping Imuran given her hepatitis went into remission. Extensive neurology work-up including lymphocytic pleocytosis was c/f possible autoimmune encephalitis. She was started on Azathioprine in March 2019 and has been considered to be in remission  - OP Hepatologist: Dr. ***** ***** - reached by email and agree with ***** held until completion of antibiotics expected February 27; clinic reached and try to set up video follow-up with patient  - OP Neurologist: Dr. ***** *****  [ ] restart ***** 150 mg daily once abx completed (anticipate February 28)    Hypothyroidism  - continue levothyroxine 100mcg daily    Chronic issues:   Depression: continue wellbutrin and lexapro  Neurogenic bladder: Continue mirabegron and tolterodine (trospium alternative)  HLD: Continue atorvastatin 10 mg   GERD: Continue pantoprazole--> changed to lansoprazole for formulary reasons    Nutritional Assessment  Moderate Chronic disease or condition related malnutrition    The patient has the following conditions and comorbidities:  Encephalopathy: Metabolic evidenced by confusion     Hypoalbuminemia (present on admission)  Sepsis (present on admission)         Physical Exam at *****  ***** *****/***** (BP Location: Left upper arm, Patient Position: Lying)  | Pulse 74  | Temp
