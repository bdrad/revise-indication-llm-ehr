The following is a copy of the progress note / assessment plan from that visit.    Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any additional questions.    *****,        *****-***** *****, MD    Electronically signed by *****-***** *****, MD on 04/28/2022, 2:58 PM    CC       I saw ***** ***** ***** ***** neurological follow-up.     Neurological Clinical Summary:   ***** ***** ***** is a 64 y.o. woman with history of autoimmune hepatitis presenting for follow-up of undifferentiated/seronegative autoimmune encephalitis. She was previously on azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis, shortly after stopping in ~September 2018, she developed severe cognitive problems, ataxia, and multifocal dyskinesias. This was initially gradual, but seemed to worsen in late 2020. Brain MRI showed nonenhancing white matter changes. CSF in October 2019 reportedly showed matched oligoclonal bands, normal IgG synthesis rate. Repeat CSF in December 2019 showed 44 WBCs (78% lymphs and 22% monos), protein 71, matched *****, elevated CSF IgG synthesis rate (could not find IgG index), glucose 76, neg for cx and fungal/TB smears/cx, cryptococcal Ab, antineuronal Ab, VDRL. Serum has shown neg ANA, ANCA, B12, ACE, TFTs, HIV, sed rate, CRP, lupus panel, *****'s DNA, drug screen. ***** are 40-50. Her neurologist Dr. ***** sent serum autoimmune encephalitis panel to Quest which was negative. ***** Ab's and thyroid 
 peroxidase Ab's were also sent and are presumed to be negative.  She had a full body CT that was negative. Her CTA of the neck and brain did not show any evidence of vasculitis. Previous outside EEG reportedly showed generalized slowing.    She was treated with IV solumedrol 1g/daily x 5 days followed by IVIG March 2020 (probably 2g/kg over 5 days), and she was restarted on azathioprine.  Repeat CSF June 2020 reportedly with WBC 8, protein 72, IgG index normal, no *****. She was then started on monthly IVIG from *****/*****-*****/*****.   Her mental status seemed to at least stabilize, but  repeat MRI brain was notable for diffuse corpus callosum T2/FLAIR hyperintensity and ventriculomegaly, with radiology report concerned for NPH. She had a repeat lumbar puncture performed which showed *****, *****, protein 60, glucose 76, IgG index 0.6, matched *****, flow cytometry neg, ***** neg. After she had the lumbar puncture, her walking and cognition seemed a little better.  She has since undergone shunt placement by neurosurgery.    Interval History and Diagnostics:  -- Admitted to UCSF for acute gangrenous cholecystitis s/p lap cholecystectomy and wash out (02/13/22).  Complicated by VP shunt exposure to purulence.  CSF studies for CNS infection were reassuring.  -- She was treated with prolonged IV antibiotics, and she was at ***** of the Valley Rehab x 3 weeks.  Her husband reports that she is doing much better cognitive and walking wise since treatment.  -- She does have a urinary tract currently, but the last infection she had was one year ago.  Her husband was glad that she was able to tell him that she was having pain with urination.  Cognitively she been slowly improving.  Her husband reports that she has been preparing food and playing with her grandchildren.    -- She has been walking more.  She did have a ***** yesterday but fell into a chair.  She gets some intermittent dizziness.  It is worse at the end of the day.  Most of the time 
 she can walk around the house with a walker.  -- She was off her azathioprine for a few weeks due the sepsis, and she is back on 150 mg daily    -- Her husband feels like they have enough support at home    Review of Systems  Otherwise negative 10 point review of systems except as noted in the HPI.

Ventricles are symmetric in size and there are no unusual extra-axial fluid collection. ***** ill-defined T2 hyperintensity is present within the central aspect of the pons seen best on image number 13 of series 3 and 9 of series 4. Elsewhere the brain signal intensity is normal. Contrast-enhanced images demonstrate no abnormal areas of enhancement. Specifically the pontine hyperintensity does not enhance.  IMPRESSION:  1. Ill-defined T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity within the pons. This is a nonspecific finding is usually seen in the setting of chronic small vessel ischemic disease. Other diagnostic considerations should include a demyelinating process, but is 
 thought less likely given the lack of additional lesions and lack of enhancement. Another possibility is pontine reversible edema which is a recognized imaging variant of hypertensive encephalopathy.  2. No acute intracranial hemorrhage, enhancing mass, acute ischemia, or evident sinus disease."    Outside brain MRI w/wo 05/29/2017:  "COMPARISON: 08/20/2009  POSITIVE FINDINGS: Motion compromised exam. Nonspecific T2 FLAIR hyperintensity within the periventricular and subcortical white matter as well as the bilateral basal ganglia. Nonspecific pontine T2 FLAIR hyperintensity is more conspicuous on the present exam. No expansile lesion of the pons. Generalized parenchymal volume loss. Bilateral maxillary fluid levels suggestive of sinusitis.  IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality."    Outside brain MRI w/wo 01/01/2018:  "COMPARISON: 05/29/2017  POSITIVE FINDINGS: Symmetric atrophy is present with resultant prominence of the CSF-containing spaces. Patchy areas of abnormal T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity are present within the periventricular and subcortical white matter as well as within the pons. The overall distribution of disease is similar to prior exam with a differential diagnosis that should include small vessel ischemic disease, demyelinating disease, and postinfectious disorders.  IMPRESSION: Stable brain MRI with continued white matter abnormalities, predominantly involving the periventricular white matter and pons. No enhancing lesion, acute hemorrhage, acute stroke."    Outside brain MRI without contrast on 1.5T scanner 10/07/2019:  "The patient could not tolerate the full complement of sequences secondary to claustrophobia and involuntary spasm. Given this limitation the following observations are made. Comparison: Prior exam 01/01/2018. Findings: Symmetric atrophy is redemonstrated. Patchy abnormal areas of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity remain present within the periventricular and subcortical 
 white matter as well as within the pons. The overall appearance is similar to prior exam. No intra-axial or extra-axial mass lesions. No intracranial hemorrhage, midline shift, or mass effect. No restricted diffusion is seen to suggest an acute cerebral infarction. The ventricles have a normal configuration. The basal cisterns are patent. No abnormal extra-axial fluid collections are noted. Normal intracranial flow-voids are present. The mastoid air cells and paranasal sinuses are well-aerated. The skull demonstrates a normal marrow signal. Impression: Atrophy with chronic small vessel ischemic change of the white matter. No acute findings. The patient could not tolerate the full complement of prescribed sequences secondary to claustrophobia and involuntary spasm."    MRI brain w/wo 07/08/2020at ***** ***** *****:      MRI brain, C/T-spine February 2021:  1. Ventriculomegaly out of proportion to cerebral atrophy and other associated findings which are highly suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus. Consider this diagnosis to explain the patient's gait abnormality.  2. No evidence of autoimmune encephalitis.  3. Cervical and thoracic spine imaging is nondiagnostic for evaluation of the spinal cord.    MRI brain, C/T-spine July 2021:  1. Compared to 02/14/2021, similar constellation of MR findings suggestive of normal pressure hydrocephalus.  2. Redemonstrated extensive and confluent white matter signal abnormality, nonspecific but most suggestive of chronic small vessel ischemic disease.  3. Multilevel degenerative changes throughout the cervical and thoracic spine, worst in the cervical spine where there is moderate canal stenosis at C4-5, C5-6, and C6-7. No spinal cord compression, cord signal abnormality, or abnormal enhancement.    Transvaginal ***** 11/28/20:  No acute findings.     PET scan February 2021:  No evidence of hypermetabolic malignancy.    Mammogram 10/16/20:  1. Benign mammographic findings. Routine 
 follow up is recommended in one year.     Neuropsych eval 11/13/20:  1. Major Neurocognitive Impairment, characterized by very prominent executive dysfunction.   2. Repeat neuropsychological assessment as clinically indicated.     IMPRESSION:   This is a 64 yo woman with a history of autoimmune hepatitis who presents for follow-up of a working diagnosis of autoimmune/inflammatory encephalitis followed by development of NPH s/p VPS.  She developed cognitive symptoms, ataxia, and multifocal dyskinesias in 2019 that partially responded to IV steroids, monthly IVIG, and maintenance azathioprine.  There was also evidence of lymphocytic pleocytosis in ***** though there were no definite active lesions seen on imaging.  Following plateau of symptoms, she was also found to have MRI changes suggestive of NPH, which responded to high volume LP and subsequent VPS placement.  She is clinically stable with even mild improvements in cognition (MOCA January 10 in August 2021 to *****/***** today) on follow-up today.  Her recent course was complicated by admission for cholecystitis/sepsis with no evidence of active ***** at that time.     RECOMMENDATIONS:  1.  Immunotherapy:  - Continue azathioprine 150 mg daily   - Check CBC w/diff, BMP, LFT in 6 months     2.  Diagnostics:  - MRI brain w/wo contrast in October 2022  - Neuropsychological Testing with Dr. ***** in the coming months   - Surveillance cancer PET scan in 1 year and annual mammogram    3.  Symptom Management:  - Continue physical therapy exercises  - Continue working with urology   - Continue with primary care team     I recommended that the patient return for a follow-up evaluation in 6 months. I provided the patient with my contact information should she have any questions or concerns in the interim.     I spent a total of 53 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with 
 the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.
