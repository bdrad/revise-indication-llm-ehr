Clinical History

The patient is 47 years old with 3.6 cm biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma

(*****-*****) of the L superior nasal cavity, no prior treatment.  The

patient undergoes tumor resection.  Intraoperative findings include

tumor involving the middle turbinate and extending anteriorly, tumor

along the left ethmoid roof just anterior to posterior ethmoid artery,

and glue-like tissue along the cribriform.







Gross Description

The case is received fresh in 19 parts each labeled with the patient's

single, irregular, red-white soft tissue fragment (0.8 x 0.7 x 0.1 cm). 

The specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis and the

frozen section remnant is submitted in cassette *****.  (cut by dab;

***** by *****)



Part B is labeled "posterior superior middle turbinate" and consists of

a single, irregular, red soft tissue fragment (0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm).  The

specimen is entirely submitted for frozen section diagnosis and the

frozen section remnant is submitted in cassette *****.  (cut by dab;

The diagnosis may have been rendered in whole, or in part, using whole

slide digital images of the glass slides on *****' FDA-approved (21

CFR *****.*****) PIPS-based platform validated at *****.



If immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry or in-situ hybridization was

performed and evaluated at ***** in the above report, all controls

performed with the stains reported above reacted appropriately. These

stains were developed and their performance characteristics determined

by the UCSF Medical Center Department of Pathology. They have not been

cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA

has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These

tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as

investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified under the

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ("CLIA") as qualified

to perform high-complexity clinical testing.



Diagnosis based on microscopic and/or gross examinations.  Final

Diagnosis made by attending pathologist following review of all

pathology slides (histochemical quality is satisfactory).  The attending

pathologist has reviewed all dictations, including prosector work, and

preliminary interpretations performed by any resident involved in the

case and performed all necessary edits before signing the final report.
