Your Follow-up Calls    As part of your health insurance benefits, the UCSF Office of Population Health is here to provide ongoing care coordination after your discharge from the hospital. You are being enrolled into a weekly call series for the next 30 days. This will happen after the after-visit phone call that all discharged patients receive. The calls will allow our team to follow-up with you regarding symptoms, medications issues, and other health needs.     To ensure that you are connected back to your primary care provider or specialist. We recommend that all recently hospitalized patients follow up with their PCP or specialist list within 7-14 days of being discharged. If you have any questions, please call our team at *****-*****-*****. We are available Monday-Friday from 9am to 5pm, and closed on weekends and holidays. Thank you.
