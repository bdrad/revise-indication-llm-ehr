OPERATIVE REPORT    PATIENT NAME: ***** *****  ***** *****: *****  DATE OF BIRTH: 01/05/1976    PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Ethmoid tumor biphenotypic sarcoma    POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:Same    INDICATIONS:47 yo M with tumor in the left ethmoid. Biopsy revealed low grade biphenotypic sarcoma. Is brought for resection of tumor.    PROCEDURE:  Endoscopic approach and resection of left ethmoid tumor of the anterior skull base with  Left maxillary antrostomy  Left sphenoidotomy  Left middle turbinate resection  ***** ethmoidectomy with removal tissue  Left frontal sinusotomy  Removal of left cribriform and ethmoid fovea bone  Resection *****  Left nasal septal flap  Brain lab image guidance    SURGEON:el-*****    *****-SURGEON:Dr.*****      ASSISTANT SURGEON: *****, MD    ANESTHESIA::GETA    FLUID:      *****:***** *****    FINDINGS:  Tumor had blood supply from the left anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries. ***** venous bleeding noted form osseous sources along the septum, nasal floor and sphenoid.  Tumor involved with middle turbinate and extend close to its root anteriorly . This was taken down  Tumor along the left ethmoid roof just anterior to posterior ethmoid artery. The bone in his region was thick and abnormal and removed up to the frontal wall, the orbit to normal bone.   Some glue-like tissue along the cribriform was cleared out and found to be "hypercellular brain tissue- not tumor" on frozen.  Tumor was cleared.   ***** defect 1cm x 9mm closed with bilayer ***** and left based nasal septal flap along the septum and up over to the orbit.    DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:      Preparation:   The head of the bed was rotated 180 degrees. The nasal cavity was packed with 4% cocaine on 3 ***** in either nostril. The oral cavity was injected with 1cc 1% lidocaine in each greater palatine foramen. The head was pinned to ***** and positioned and the then registered with image guidance using the facial 
 scanning technique.  Due to distortion of the regular, complex anatomy the tumor was then examined with the image guidance and a decision to proceed with endoscopic approach was made. The anterior half of the head and face were prepped with betadine and draped in a sterile fashion. The abdomen was prepped in the event a fat graft was required.    The nasal packing was removed and the lesion was examined with an endoscope. The mass was noted to be in the left nasal cavity within the middle turbinate. It extended into the ethmoid. There were some changes along the septum where it touched but no obvious tumor. This portion was cut our and removed (during the raising of the septal flap). .     The inferior turbinates were out fractured bilaterally.     On the left : Maxillary antrostomy  Next A left wide maxillary antrostomy was performed. The turbinate was ***** and the left anterior ethmoid was identified. The left maxillary antrum was incised with a back ***** and the uncinate taken down with a *****. The antrum was opened widely with a ***** and down *****.  The uncinate was resected up to the ***** cell with ***** and then the ethmoid ***** was resected. The tumor ws exposed in the posterior ethmoid as there was no basal lamella.      SPA Identification and NSF Preparation  Next the left sphenopalatine artery was identified by elevating the mucosa off the maxillary wall until the ***** ethmoidalis was identified. The sphenopalatine artery foramen was identified.. Next cuts were made with ***** below the foramen back to the choanae. The mucosal cuts above the SPA were made back to the anterior wall to allow rotation and define the inferior limit of the resection. The ethmoid sinus above the foramen was removed to ***** ***** vessel.     The middle  turbinate was the cauterized anteriorly along the skull base and then along the base near the side wall. It ws resected exposing the tumor which 
 had grown through it. Superiorly the tumor seemed to invest the into the middle turbinate. It approximated the skull base anteriorly but frozen section showed it did not reach the skull base in the turbinate anteriorly. The tumor was vascular and we then approached this anteriorly.    Tumor debulking  At this point the tumor was *****. First I defined the relation to the lateral wall and found it did not invade the lamina and that there were normal ethmoid sinus along the bones which were compressed to the orbit.     I then opened the ***** cell further and exposed the frontal sinus. ***** ***** III was performed and this opened the skull base. At this point the frontal sinus was identified. There was mucus retention cyst in the frontal sinus and this was drained. Next the anterior ethmoid artery ws bleeding and this ws cauterized and packed with ***** and bipolar.     Sphenoidotomy  The sphenoid os was located and opened laterally to the orbit. Mucus was suctioned out and not tumor present. Tumor debrided from the ethmoid to see the sphenoid and the anterior wall was opened. The os was then incised anteriorly along the septum with  ***** about 1cm preserving the pedicle of a nasal septal flap.    *****  At this point, next a left tumor resection with ethmoidectomy was performed.  At this point, the tumor was noted to involve the anterior skull base along the posterior ethmoid and  the middle turbinate inferiorly. The tumor was truncated along the skull base but some was left at the fovea. I then ***** the tumor off the skull base and it was adherent to the bone which bleed as tumor was removed. As I did this ***** along the inset of the middle turbinate was noted with some CSF. I then drilled the bone along the fovea from the frontal sinus back to the anterior sphenoid. The posterior ethmoid artery was now ligated with cautery. I could now completely remove the anterior sphenoid wall. At this point I 
 began to remove the bone of the skull base and ***** it and we consulted out neurosurgical colleague Dr.*****.    ***** together we proceed to take down the skull base bone and it was noted to be abnormal and thick and looked involved with tumor. The ***** under looked clean. The tumor ws taken from the turbinate in midline at olfactory cleft to the orbit and the orbit ridge was taken along the ethmoid.       ***** exposure  At this point, the ***** was exposed of the skull base with the olfactory tract and the fovea. We incised the ***** laterally and then ***** it down over the region involved by tumor more medially to the middle turbinate. The dural resection was about 1cm x 1cm. The brain over it appeared clean except near the middle turbinate where the was some abnormal tissue. We then peeled the left olfactory nerve out and some irregular tissue which came back on frozen as not tumor.     A CSF leak now existed.     A large nasal septal flap was harvested. I continued the incision along the choanae and up onto the septum and then down to the floor. I then cut forward to the anterior junction of the nasal cavity floor past the lesser palatine foramen.   Next I incised along os forward to the level of the anterior edge of the middle turbinate. At this point I then ***** up to the nasal dorsum and then forward to the anterior nasal tip. I then made a vertical incision about 1cm posterior to the caudal septum down to the floor and joined with the floor. Dissection from the floor up to the septum and the from anteriorly ***** ***** the flap off the septum and the anterior sphenoid wall. I marked it blue for lateral use.       Next I patched the dural defect with a ***** bilayer about 30% bigger than the defect for inner and 40% bigger on outer layer.  Defect with one layer placed inlay and one over the bone.     I the rotated the NSF flap along the nasal septum and up to the skull base. Over the 
 defect, and then back onto the orbit. This ws ***** with small pieces of ***** in adjacent sinuses of sphenoid and frontal and the held in place with ***** seal glue. Next ***** was packed into the place and then the silastic splints were placed and then 10 cm *****.   ***** ***** *****-*****, MD, M.D.,FACS  Co-Director Center for Minimally Invasive Skull Base Surgery    Otolaryngology- Head and ***** *****  ***** California ***** *****
