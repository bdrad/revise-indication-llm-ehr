The patient was having an endoscopic resection of what appeared to be entirely extracranial tumor when the bone lateral to the olfactory groove was found to be involved and I was called into the room to help resect that.   Findings     Intracranial tumor found and resected next to the left olfactory tract.    Detailed Description of Procedure     Under the benefits of general anesthesia the patient was positioned supine on the operating room table.  A timeout was performed to confirm patient identity, allergies, preoperative medications, surgical procedure, special equipment, postoperative disposition, anticipated difficulties.    The patient's head was placed in the ***** pin headrest.  The registration of imaging to physical space was carried out with the Brain Lab System.  We confirmed the  accuracy of the registration set using anatomic landmarks.    I was called in the operating room by Dr. ***** *****.  On visual endoscopic inspection the bone lateral to the left olfactory groove appeared involved and I proceeded 
 in using ***** ***** to resect it all the way to the medial margin of the orbit and periorbita.  The ***** appeared questionably involved but once a wide resection of the bone was achieved we decided to resect the *****.  Using the retractable blade and endoscopic ***** ***** then resected the ***** exposing the subfrontal area and almost the entire length of the left olfactory tract.  There was clear tumor along the area of the olfactory tract into the bulb and I used ring ***** to resect that.  Specimens both of the bone and ***** as well as the tumor were sent for pathologic evaluation.    By the end of the resection I sectioned and resected the olfactory tract on the left.  Complete hemostasis was achieved and I turned the case back to *****. ***** ***** for the closure.    Estimated Blood Loss: 10cc for this part of the procedure.    Specimens to Pathology: specimens for frozen and permanent pathologic examination.    Condition at end of operation: stable    Disposition and Plan: PACU and then neuro floor.    The primary surgeon (listed above) was scrubbed and present throughout the entire surgical procedure. If the assistant surgeon was other than a qualified resident, I certify that the services were medically necessary and there was no qualified resident available to perform the services.
