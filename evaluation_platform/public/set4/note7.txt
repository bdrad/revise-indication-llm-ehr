PHYSICAL THERAPY TREATMENT NOTE    PT relevant HPI   52F h/o recovered *****+, NF1, tectal glioma and obstructive hydrocephalus s/p multiple shunt revisions (most recently ***** 11/16/20, Strata NSC @ 1.5) with LSO with gynonc, now p/w 1d AMS, found to have hydrocephalus.    Medical Update:    NG tube placement today    ASSESSMENT   Pt continues to be at high risk for falls November 10 retropulsion, delayed initiation/motor planning, impaired motor control, impulsivity, and decreased gait speed. She requires Min A for transfers with FWW and Min-Mod A to ambulate ***** ***** ***** with FWW and ***** verbal cues for sequencing and safety. Pt continues to be disoriented and ***** poor insight, and would currently require assistance with all mobility to safely discharge home. She will benefit from skilled PT and placement for continued therapy to improve her motor control, balance and endurance for increased safety and independence with functional mobility.    Focus next session:  neuro re-ed, transfers, gait, balance    RECOMMENDATIONS  DISCHARGE RECOMMENDATION  Comments  Placement with ongoing PT needs     Patient ***** ***** ***** Sufficient for PT Discharge Recommendation  Yes   Discharge DME needs  TBD   Discharge transportation needs  ***** chair van   Rehab Potential  Patient participates well in therapy and progressing towards goals, Patient will be able to tolerate 3 hours of therapy     NURSING RECOMMENDATIONS  Inpatient Rehab Assistive Device Recommendation  *****   ***** Recommendation  1p assist for OOB to chair/commode     SUBJECTIVE  Subjective report:   "***** is my birthday.
