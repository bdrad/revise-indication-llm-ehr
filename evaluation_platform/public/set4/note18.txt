PHYSICAL THERAPY TREATMENT NOTE    PT relevant HPI   52F h/o recovered *****+, NF1, tectal glioma and obstructive hydrocephalus s/p multiple shunt revisions (most recently ***** 11/16/20, Strata NSC @ 1.5) with LSO with gynonc, now p/w 1d AMS, found to have hydrocephalus.    ASSESSMENT   Patient demonstrates impaired motor control and motor planning requiring Mod A ambulating 30 ft x 2 with a FWW and requiring max verbal cues for sequencing and safety. She currently would require assistance with all mobility to safely discharge home. She will benefit from skilled PT and placement for continued therapy to improve her motor control, balance and endurance for increased safety and independence with functional mobility.    Focus next session:  neuro re-ed, transfers, gait, balance    RECOMMENDATIONS  DISCHARGE RECOMMENDATION  Comments  Placement with ongoing PT needs     Patient ***** ***** ***** Sufficient for PT Discharge Recommendation  Yes   Discharge DME needs  TBD   Discharge transportation needs  ***** chair van   Rehab Potential  Patient participates well in therapy and progressing towards goals     NURSING RECOMMENDATIONS  Inpatient Rehab Assistive Device Recommendation  *****   ***** Recommendation  OOB to chair/commode     SUBJECTIVE  Subjective report:   "I have to think a lot."  Notable observations:   Supine in bed with HOB elevated with bed alarm on at beginning of session. Seated in chair with chair alarm pad (no alarm box) and ***** belt to front at end of session.
