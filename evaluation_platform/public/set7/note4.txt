Clinical Note | 2022-03-14 08:06:00
Hello Team,      This patient ***** negative and only requires ***** Point of Care Test (POCT) the day prior to ***** on the day of procedure/appt.       CATCH Nursing team has entered the POCT lab order and an Ambulatory Referral to ***** testing, meaning a member of the central ***** test scheduling team will reach out to schedule the POCT based on your team's recommendations. If the patient does not want to wait to be called, they can call the ***** at *****-*****-*****, option 2 to schedule.      Please ensure the ***** test was completed and negative upon patient's arrival for the appt/procedure by asking the patient for their clearance form from *****.      CATCH nursing team will be deleting from the ***** once the POCT appointment is made. Please enroll patient on new ***** if procedure date changes.       *****://*****.*****.*****/*****/*****/*****/*****/*****/*****_*****_*****.*****      Regards,   CATCH Nursing Team
