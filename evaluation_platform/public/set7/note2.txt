Patient Name: ***** *****  *****: 12/22/1963  Medical Record: *****    Referring provider: Provider, ***** ***** *****    Reason for visit: ***** ***** ***** ***** with Aspergillus on bronch, now with ***** on July BAL    HPI: Mr. ***** is a 58yo man with IDDM, *****/siderosis c/b pHTN s/p ***** 10/18/2017 (on tac/***** 7.5), previously seen in ***** clinic for Aspergillus on multiple ***** and pulmonary nodules, now with ***** on BAL from July 2022.    Timeline:  - Starting in December 2017, has intermittently grown rare Aspergillus spp on surveillance ***** - different species including *****, flavus, fumigatus, nidulans  - 01/20/18: ID e-consult for Rhizopus and Aspergillus on surveillance bronch. No radiographic signs of IFI or reported symptoms; likely colonizer, but agree with plan for posa ppx x 3 months given recent lung transplant  - February 2020: admitted with severe ***** requiring intubation and pressors  - 01/14/21: ID e-consult for cough and decreased lung function with rare sterile mycelium and few penicillium - no CT evidence of fungal infection, rec ongoing monitoring  - June 2021: switched to vori  - 10/26/21: CT chest with "increasing clustered irregular nodules in the right upper lobe, including some of which with mild cavitary/cystic changes, most likely to reflect worsening infection, possibly of a different etiology"  - 01/04/22: CT chest with e/o bronchiolitis, "waxing and waning solid component of multiple small cystic/cavitary nodules in the left lower and right upper lobes concerning for infection. Overall there is a 
 slight increase in solid component associated with these lesions"   - 01/18/22: first ID clinic: nodules subtle and nonspecific; continue vori and await ***** ***** susceptibilities  - 04/14/22: ID clinic: ongoing cough and shortness of breath; vori active against ***** ***** isolate, repeat CT chest somewhat improved, unclear whether nodules are related to ***** ***** vs ***** ***** is colonizer, cont vori, repeat galactomannan with next routine labs.   - 08/02/22: CT chest: "No significant change in scattered patchy groundglass opacities and a few cavitary nodules, concerning for evolving infection and/or acute rejection."  - 08/07/22: BAL growing ***** (smear negative) - first time this organism has grown. Bronch with purulent secretions.  - 08/31/22: last ID clinic: imaging not convincing for pulmonary *****, though symptoms could be compatible; await repeat imaging and BAL planned for early September  - Repeat imaging and BAL now planned for later this month    Today the patient reports:  - Nothing has changed symptomatically since last visit   - Has continued to have slow weight loss  - Cough and dyspnea with exertion similar to last visit - sometimes feels like it's getting worse  - No fevers  - Voriconazole is still giving him nightmares though still more bothered by his breathing    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  Past Medical History:   Diagnosis Date    BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia)     CHEST WALL Pain after L lung biopsy 04/25/2012    Diabetes mellitus, type 2 (CMS code)     Diverticulosis     Hyperlipidemia     Hypertension     Lung transplant status, bilateral (CMS code) 10/18/2017    for idiopathic Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia and pulmonary hypertension.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN  Mr. ***** is a 58yo man with IDDM, *****/siderosis c/b pHTN s/p ***** 10/18/2017 (on tac/***** 7.5), previously seen in ***** clinic for Aspergillus on multiple ***** and pulmonary nodules, now with ***** on from July 2022 BAL.     With regard to the Aspergillus - his pulmonary nodules seem completely unaffected by azole therapy, and this is therefore most likely colonization.     With regard to the ***** - he does have multiple clinical symptoms that would be compatible with NTM infection. Most of his symptoms are chronic, however, and his known CLAD is an alternate explanation for many of them. ***** has never been isolated from prior *****, and since ***** is usually not difficult to culture from lower tract samples if present, it seems unlikely that ***** could fully explain his more chronic symptoms. Last CT chest reviewed with radiology was fairly unimpressive, with subtle findings overall and none that are classic for *****. That said, he is at risk for NTM infection and with his immunosuppression and his symptoms, I would have a very low threshold to treat if repeat imaging is at all suggestive of NTM infection.     Plan  - Awaiting repeat CT chest and BAL  - Azithro for BOS ppx is being held pending decision re ***** treatment  - Continue vori for now    RTC: 3 months, but will follow up above studies in the interim    I spent a total of 45 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or 
 caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.
