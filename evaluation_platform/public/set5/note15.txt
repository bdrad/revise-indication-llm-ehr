It was a pleasure seeing you in ***** clinic today!    Here are our recommendations as we discussed in clinic today:    - you can stop the prevacid after you come off the prednisone  - complete the course of prednisone 50mg daily that you have now  - after this, start prednisone 40mg daily for 7 days and then taper by 5mg per week  - after about a month, you can stop the vitamin C and iron supplements as well  - you can stop the mesalamine entirely  - refer to the crohn's and colitis foundation for further guidance on IBD  - Please call the radiology department to schedule your MR enterography at *****-*****-*****   - If symptoms worsen, contact us and let us know  - Call us at (*****) *****-***** with any questions with any issues that may arise on ***** and weekends      Please do not hesitate to contact us on MyChart with any questions.    Vedolizumab    Vedolizumab (Entyvio) is an antibody to alpha-4-beta-7 approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It reduces gastrointestinal inflammation by selectively blocking the entry of inflammation-promoting lymphocytes (white blood cells) into the gastrointestinal tract. It is given as an intravenous infusion.    Dose and Schedule:  The standard starting dose is 300 mg at week 0, 2, and 6, followed by every 8 weeks thereafter. The drug should be taken on a regular schedule, without interruption, for maximal effectiveness. It may take up to 3 months to see a full response.      Monitoring:  Prior to starting, a test for tuberculosis (PPD or Quantiferon) and for hepatitis serologies must be done  Blood tests: complete blood count, kidney function, and liver tests every 3-4 months once stable  Clinical evaluation in person or by video every 6 months.     Note: Refills and electronic advice cannot be given unless evaluated in clinic at a regular interval as noted above    If your insurance is changing or you need prior 
 authorization you must provide our   office with at least 4 weeks notice in order to obtain timely refills    Risks of Vedolizumab:  Infections, mostly upper respiratory infections  There is no FDA warning for opportunistic infections like tuberculosis with this drug.  However, out of caution, exposure to hepatitis B and tuberculosis must be evaluated, and possibly treated, prior to *****.  There is no FDA warning for lymphoma  While it has a similar mechanism of action to a drug that carries a risk of a neurologic disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), based on the gut-centered mechanism of action of vedolizumab, it is not thought to cause PML, and no cases of PML have been detected in patients taking vedolizumab (including in clinical trials and in post marketing surveillance).  There is no requirement to monitor for ***** virus while on the drug.    While it is possible to develop anti-drug antibodies to vedolizumab that ***** the drug inactive, the development of persistent antibodies in studies was low. To help prevent the development of antibodies, doses should be taken on a regular schedule, without interruption.     Note: If you have a fever, infection or other concern, please check with your gastroenterologist before taking OR skipping a dose.    Healthcare Maintenance while on Vedolizumab  Discuss the following with your primary care provider:  1. Vaccination: Patients should follow standard vaccination protocols for their age group.  Patients on ***** should not receive live vaccines. The following INACTIVE vaccines are recommended.  IBD patients should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B   IBD patients should receive annual influenza vaccination  IBD patients ?18 years old should receive the inactive ***** vaccination (*****). This is now FDA approved for those who are  immunosuppressed  IBD patients should receive pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination. If 
 not immunosuppressed: Consider vaccination with ***** (*****). If immunosuppressed: Vaccinate with ***** (*****) followed by ***** (*****) = 8 weeks later followed by ***** booster after 5 years.   Reference: *****.*****.*****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****-*****-*****.*****  IBD patients should be up to date with Td or TDaP every 10 years  Females and males June 10  should receive HPV vaccination, consider vaccination if age 27-45 and at risk for new HPV infection    2. Dermatologic examination: There is a theoretical increased risk for melanomas and non ***** skin cancers. Patients should have their skin checked annually and limit sun exposure. They should use appropriate sun protection at all times.    3. Papanicolau smears: Women should have more frequent pap smears.  Men and women at risk should have anal pap smears.    4. Bone density scans: Recommended for patients with exposure to corticosteroids and nontraumatic fractures as well as IBD patients over the age of 50.    5. Eye exams: Annual eye exams are recommended for all patients with prior history of corticosteroid use.    6. Colon Cancer Surveillance:  After 8 years of disease, patients with ulcerative colitis and *****'s colitis should have surveillance colonoscopies every 1-2 years with biopsies or chromoendoscopy. The risk of colorectal cancer increases in patients who have had the disease at a younger age, and based on extent of disease, duration of disease, and family history of colorectal cancer.  A history of primary sclerosing cholangitis also increases risk and these patients need annual colonoscopy from diagnosis.      Ustekinumab    Ustekinumab (Stelara) is an antibody against pro-inflammatory cytokines ***** and 23.  It is FDA approved for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate to severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The first dose is given as an intravenous infusion; subsequent doses are given as a subcutaneous 
 injection.     Dose and Schedule:  The initial induction dose is given intravenously based on weight (<55 kg = 260 mg; 55-85 kg = 390 mg; >85 kg is 520 mg), followed by a subcutaneous injection of 90 mg 8 weeks later. Maintenance dosing is then given by subcutaneous injection every 8 weeks at 90 mg.    Monitoring:  Prior to starting, a test for tuberculosis (PPD or QuantiFERON) and for hepatitis serologies must be done  Blood tests: complete blood count, kidney function, and liver tests every 3-4 months once stable  Clinical evaluation in person or by video every 6 months.     Note: Refills and electronic advice cannot be given unless evaluated in clinic at a regular interval as noted above    If your insurance is changing or you need prior authorization you must provide our   office with at least 4 weeks' notice in order to obtain timely refills    Risks of Ustekinumab  Serious infections  Malignancy, though there is no FDA warning for lymphoma  Exposure to hepatitis B and tuberculosis must be evaluated, and possibly treated, prior to initiation of ustekinumab, though the risk of tuberculosis appears to be lower than with anti-TNF agents.   There is a theoretical risk of developing anti-drug antibody and increased clearance which would lead to reduced effectiveness of the drug and possible side effects.  To help prevent the development of antibodies, doses should be taken on a regular schedule, without interruption.     Note: If you have a fever, infection or other concern, please check with your gastroenterologist before taking OR skipping a dose.    Healthcare Maintenance while on Ustekinumab  Discuss the following with your primary care provider:  1. Vaccination: Patients should follow standard vaccination protocols for their age group.  Patients on ***** should not receive live vaccines. The following INACTIVE vaccines are recommended.  IBD patients should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B 
   IBD patients should receive annual influenza vaccination  IBD patients ?18 years old should receive the inactive ***** vaccination (*****). This is now FDA approved for those who are  immunosuppressed  IBD patients should receive pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination. If not immunosuppressed: Consider vaccination with ***** (*****). If immunosuppressed: Vaccinate with ***** (*****) followed by ***** (*****) = 8 weeks later followed by ***** booster after 5 years.   Reference: *****.*****.*****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****-*****-*****.*****  IBD patients should be up to date with Td or TDaP every 10 years  Females and males June 10  should receive HPV vaccination, consider vaccination if age 27-45 and at risk for new HPV infection    2. Dermatologic examination: There is a theoretical increased risk for melanomas and non-melanoma skin cancers with ustekinumab. Patients should have their skin checked annually and limit sun exposure. They should use appropriate sun protection at all times.    3. ***** smears: Women should have more frequent pap smears.  Men and women at risk should have anal pap smears.    4.
