Nutrition Diagnosis  KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT related to oral diet as evidenced by patient with questions on what to eat    Nutrition Intervention  Comparative Standards:  I did not assess    Diet  Follow a plant based diet that includes daily consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, at each meal as much as possible.    Include a protein at each meal, between plant and animal based.  October 18 oz chicken, turkey, fish  September 16 cup beans, lentils  September 16 cup of quinoa  handful of nuts  September 16 TBSP nut *****  September 16 cup tofu  September 16 cup edamame  Choose whole grains.  September 16 cup oatmeal  September 16 cup quinoa  1 ***** tortilla  1 ***** whole wheat bread  Add a fruit or a vegetable to each meal in September 16 cup serving size. The goal eventually is to eat fruits/vegetables with five servings a day (based on the size of a fist). Sent her a list of GI friendly fruits, vegetables, legumes to help make substitutions where needed.  Eat healthful unsaturated fats of avocado, nuts and fish into the diet at least once a day 3x/week. Limit saturated fats and no trans 
 fats.  Limit sugary foods (e.g., candy, cakes, cookies, *****) as much as possible. If eaten, should be shared, in small amounts and not consumed daily.  Drink at least 64 ounces of fluids daily, this is close to 2 L/day. Limit sugary beverages such as sodas and fruit juices to twice monthly. ***** on water or unsweetened iced tea at meals.  Plan for at least three meals at set mealtimes each day. For well balanced meals, divide plate into four sections and each corner of the plate, put a different food group of September 16-1 cup of food (e.g., protein, dairy, whole grain, fruit or vegetable). Be cautious of second *****. Do not go back for second ***** until the first ***** are eaten.      ***** foods at restaurants as much as possible.      Nutrition Monitoring/Evaluation  Maintain current body weight within 1-2% range.  Improve tolerance to diet without reports of gastrointestinal symptoms of N/V, altered bowel habits, gas, bloating and cramping    Follow up visits are recommended to help monitor progress and troubleshoot issues as they arise so we can continue to strive towards meeting goals.    Patient is aware to call the clinic or send the dietitian a My Chart message if there are questions or concerns.
