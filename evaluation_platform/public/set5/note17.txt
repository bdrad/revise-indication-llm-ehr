Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools.      History of Present Illness  ***** is a 19 y.o. female with a history of low grade glioma and related seizures who was recently hospitalized for acute on chronic abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea in the setting of unintentional weight loss and was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.    IBD history:  She notes having symptoms since October 2022 with pain and blood in the stools. This lasted for 2 weeks and symptoms normalized. She then had another flare up in March with bloody diarrhea once every 30 minutes. She was ultimately hospitalized on 04/04/23. Labs were significant for CRP of 18.9, ESR 30, fecal calprotectin of > 3000. C difficile testing was negative. Vitamin D level was low at 16.9 and iron studies were low as well. She was discharged on liquid iron supplementation and calcium.  She underwent EGD and colonoscopy on 04/06/23 while inpatient that revealed multiple continuous friable mucosal tissue in the colon most consistent with ulcerative colitis.    She was then started on IV steroids with symptomatic improvement. Mesalamine was also started on April 08 and she was transitioned from ***** to PO 
 steroids. She was discharged on April 10. CRP had normalized at the time to 3.7. Albumin at time of discharge was low at 3.2    Patient feels that she is having an allergic reaction to the mesalamine (lialda 4.8 grams daily). She notes having hives as well as redness all over, including her face. She put ice on the areas and took zyrtec which has helped.   She is currently taking prednisone 50mg daily and was advised to ***** it daily for a few days and then stop, without any taper.  She notes that her number of bowel movements is decreased. Her last BM was now 2 days ago with very minimal blood. She had a black ***** stool this morning.    She is currently having a bowel movement once every other day.  She does have ***** currently and symptoms include cough and sore throat. Sh was prescribed ***** but has not yet started taking this.    No IBD or colon cancer in the family.

Colonoscopy showed continuous involvement from rectum through cecum without ***** involvement and pathology showed chronic colitis consistent with ulcerative colitis. She has had significant clinical improvement on IV methylprednisolone and now PO prednisone. She is having one BM every other day and blood has decreased. For maintenance, she is on lialda but developed hives all over which are likely due to mesalamine. We discussed that with decreasing prednisone dose, her reaction to mesalamine could worsen. Moreover, given the severity of her flare, a more efficacious advanced therapy may be warranted regardless. We discussed starting either stelara or entyvio given their safety profile. Patient and family will review these options and get back to us.  Moreover, we discussed that she should do a slow prednisone taper as opposed to abruptly discontinuing after 5 days.    - prednisone 40mg daily x7 days then taper by 5mg per week  - stop mesalamine given allergic reaction  - start vit D supplementation at 50,000 international units weekly x 8 weeks  - patient will inform us if she will start entyvio or stelara for maintenance  - quantiferon negative and hep B immune  - will check labs once maintenance therapy is started with first infusion  - MR enterography 
 when possible to rule out small bowel disease  - video visit follow up in 1-2 months      CC: ***** ***** *****, MD      I spent a total of 90 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    Ustekinumab    Ustekinumab (Stelara) is an antibody against pro-inflammatory cytokines ***** and 23.  It is FDA approved for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate to severe Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The first dose is given as an intravenous infusion; subsequent doses are given as a subcutaneous injection.     Dose and Schedule:  The initial induction dose is given intravenously based on weight (<55 kg = 260 mg; 55-85 kg = 390 mg; >85 kg is 520 mg), followed by a subcutaneous injection of 90 mg 8 weeks later. Maintenance dosing is then given by subcutaneous injection every 8 weeks at 90 mg.    Monitoring:  Prior to starting, a test for tuberculosis (PPD or QuantiFERON) and for hepatitis serologies must be done  Blood tests: complete blood count, kidney function, and liver tests every 3-4 months once stable  Clinical evaluation in person or by video every 6 months.     Note: Refills and electronic advice cannot be given unless evaluated in clinic at a regular interval as noted above    If your insurance is changing or you need prior authorization you must provide our   office with at least 4 weeks' notice in order to obtain timely refills    Risks of Ustekinumab  Serious infections  Malignancy, though there is no FDA warning for lymphoma  Exposure to hepatitis B and tuberculosis must be evaluated, and possibly 
 treated, prior to initiation of ustekinumab, though the risk of tuberculosis appears to be lower than with anti-TNF agents.   There is a theoretical risk of developing anti-drug antibody and increased clearance which would lead to reduced effectiveness of the drug and possible side effects.  To help prevent the development of antibodies, doses should be taken on a regular schedule, without interruption.     Note: If you have a fever, infection or other concern, please check with your gastroenterologist before taking OR skipping a dose.    Healthcare Maintenance while on Ustekinumab  Discuss the following with your primary care provider:  1. Vaccination: Patients should follow standard vaccination protocols for their age group.  Patients on ***** should not receive live vaccines. The following INACTIVE vaccines are recommended.  IBD patients should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B   IBD patients should receive annual influenza vaccination  IBD patients =18 years old should receive the inactive ***** vaccination (*****). This is now FDA approved for those who are  immunosuppressed  IBD patients should receive pneumococcal pneumonia vaccination. If not immunosuppressed: Consider vaccination with ***** (*****). If immunosuppressed: Vaccinate with ***** (*****) followed by ***** (*****) = 8 weeks later followed by ***** booster after 5 years.   Reference: *****.*****.*****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****-*****-*****.*****  IBD patients should be up to date with Td or TDaP every 10 years  Females and males June 10  should receive HPV vaccination, consider vaccination if age 27-45 and at risk for new HPV infection    2. Dermatologic examination: There is a theoretical increased risk for melanomas and non-melanoma skin cancers with ustekinumab. Patients should have their skin checked annually and limit sun exposure. They should use appropriate sun protection at all times.    3. ***** smears: 
 Women should have more frequent pap smears.  Men and women at risk should have anal pap smears.    4. Bone density scans: Recommended for patients with exposure to corticosteroids and nontraumatic fractures as well as IBD patients over the age of 50.    5. Eye exams: Annual eye exams are recommended for all patients with prior history of corticosteroid use.    6. Colon Cancer Surveillance:  After 8 years of disease, patients with *****'s colitis should have surveillance colonoscopies every 1-2 years with biopsies or chromoendoscopy. The risk of colorectal cancer increases in patients who have had the disease at a younger age, and based on extent of disease, duration of disease, and family history of colorectal cancer.  A history of primary sclerosing cholangitis also increases risk and these patients need annual colonoscopy from diagnosis.        Vedolizumab    Vedolizumab (Entyvio) is an antibody to alpha-4-beta-7 approved by the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. It reduces gastrointestinal inflammation by selectively blocking the entry of inflammation-promoting lymphocytes (white blood cells) into the gastrointestinal tract. It is given as an intravenous infusion.    Dose and Schedule:  The standard starting dose is 300 mg at week 0, 2, and 6, followed by every 8 weeks thereafter. The drug should be taken on a regular schedule, without interruption, for maximal effectiveness. It may take up to 3 months to see a full response.      Monitoring:  Prior to starting, a test for tuberculosis (PPD or Quantiferon) and for hepatitis serologies must be done  Blood tests: complete blood count, kidney function, and liver tests every 3-4 months once stable  Clinical evaluation in person or by video every 6 months.     Note: Refills and electronic advice cannot be given unless evaluated in clinic at a regular interval as noted above    If your insurance is changing or you need 
 prior authorization you must provide our   office with at least 4 weeks notice in order to obtain timely refills    Risks of Vedolizumab:  Infections, mostly upper respiratory infections  There is no FDA warning for opportunistic infections like tuberculosis with this drug.  However, out of caution, exposure to hepatitis B and tuberculosis must be evaluated, and possibly treated, prior to *****.  There is no FDA warning for lymphoma  While it has a similar mechanism of action to a drug that carries a risk of a neurologic disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), based on the gut-centered mechanism of action of vedolizumab, it is not thought to cause PML, and no cases of PML have been detected in patients taking vedolizumab (including in clinical trials and in post marketing surveillance).  There is no requirement to monitor for ***** virus while on the drug.    While it is possible to develop anti-drug antibodies to vedolizumab that ***** the drug inactive, the development of persistent antibodies in studies was low. To help prevent the development of antibodies, doses should be taken on a regular schedule, without interruption.     Note: If you have a fever, infection or other concern, please check with your gastroenterologist before taking OR skipping a dose.    Healthcare Maintenance while on Vedolizumab  Discuss the following with your primary care provider:  1. Vaccination: Patients should follow standard vaccination protocols for their age group.
