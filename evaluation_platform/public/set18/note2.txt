This Certified Child ***** Specialist (*****) met patient 22 months old with Father (FOP) to assess coping, provide preparation, and procedural support for MRI scan with anesthesia.

Per FOP report, patient has had prior MRI with anesthesia and expressed understanding of routine. ***** provided patient the opportunity to view, touch, and breathe through an anesthesia mask to familiarize to MRI anesthesia routine.
