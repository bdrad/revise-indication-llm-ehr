Discharge Instructions for Pediatric Radiologic Exams with Anesthesia     Your child may sleep for several hours after the procedure.  Your child should wake up easily but may ***** back asleep even up until the next morning.  Children who have had sedation may act silly or drunk and should not walk without someone holding their hand.  They should be protected from situations that require quick reflexes such as using stairs or riding a bicycle.     Your child may feel irritable and cry and he/she may complain of a headache.  Your child should be protected in the car, as he/she normally would be, using either a safety seat or seat belt.  An adult should sit next to the child to ensure the child's head is stable.    Before you give your child solid food, first give him/her sips of liquids.  If your child tolerates the first few sips without vomiting, you may allow him/her to eat a regular meal.  If your child vomits, wait a few hours and try again.  Your child may feel like vomiting for several hours after the procedure.    Observe the area on your child's arm or leg where he/she received the medication injection.  It may appear warm and tender.  If it should become swollen and red in appearance, call your family physician.    If you need copies of the scan to take with you to your child's appointment, please inform the technologist responsible for your study.  Once the scan is completed, a radiologist or nuclear medicine doctor will review and discuss the results with your child's doctor.  Your child's doctor will discuss the results with you.    If you are concerned about your child's behavior (such as excessive sleepiness or vomiting) or if anything else concerns you, call *****-*****-***** and ask to speak with the pediatric anesthesiologist on call.  In an emergency, call 911 or go to the Emergency Room at your local hospital.
