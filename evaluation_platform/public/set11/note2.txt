Heterogeneous attenuation within the lower innominate vein and upper SVC is favored to represent mixing 
 artifact. No definite SVC thrombus or pulmonary embolism. If further evaluation of the superior vena cava is desired, recommend CT chest venogram protocol. 2. Left greater than right lower lobe airways impaction, with bilateral lower lobe consolidation and scattered groundglass opacities, favored to represent aspiration with or without superimposed infection. 3. Multifocal peripheral groundglass may reflect sequela of aspiration versus organizing pneumonia.

Report dictated by: ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** ***** *****, MBBS Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging     US Doppler Upper Extremity Venous, Right    Result Date: 05/20/2023  1. Right upper extremity positive for DVT, with thrombus visualized in the subclavian, axillary, and basilic veins. The innominate vein is questionable for slow flow versus thrombus. Proximal extent of thrombus is not visualized. CT scan of the chest with contrast is recommended for further evaluation of proximal extent of thrombus. //Impression 1 discussed with ***** *****, MD by ***** ***** *****, MD (Radiology) on *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM.// Report dictated by: ***** ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** *****, MD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging     ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  ***** ***** is a 57 y.o. female w/ hx uncontrolled HTN ***** aneurysmal SAH s/p EVD placement (May 04), angio and R M2 aneurysm clipping (May 05), c/c/b edema and midline shift now s/p R decompressive ***** (May 06).

Given that patient is outside of the spasm window (day 18 post bleed) has had stable improvement in exam, and reassuring TCDs will liberalize her blood pressure goals and neurologic monitoring.

Pain has been difficult to control despite escalating opiate doses and multimodal pain management strategies. While head and neck pain is common after SAH, current reports of pain have not improved even after receiving doses of pain medications. Possible component of perseveration regarding pain as a result of her R MCA territory involvement in addition to underlying pain. Additionally, has chart history of opiate use disorder; quit January 2022.
