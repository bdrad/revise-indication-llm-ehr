Compared to 05/14/2023, slight increase in ventricle size and increase in fluid at right hemicraniectomy site, now measuring 11 mm in thickness, previously 4 mm. 2.

Enteric tube and right PICC are unchanged. New patchy airspace opacity throughout the mid to lower right lung which may reflect combination of atelectasis and aspiration/infection.

 Radiology and Biomedical Imaging     ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  ***** ***** is a 57 y.o. female w/ hx uncontrolled HTN ***** aneurysmal SAH s/p EVD placement (May 04), angio and R M2 aneurysm clipping (May 05), c/c/b edema and midline shift now s/p R decompressive ***** (May 06).     NEUROLOGIC     #SAH, ***** *****, s/p angio/clipping May 05, c/b midline shift s/p DHC September/p EVD removal May 19  CTA at ***** with ***** aneurysm in the right M1 bifurcation. DSA revealed aneurysm at R M2 branch. S/p EVD placement May 04 and R pterional crani for aneurysm clipping May 05. Now s/p DHC May 06 for refractory high ***** and worsening midline shift. EVD Removed May 19. Exam continuing to improve, with more function in ***** as of May 18. Post bleed day 16. Given that patient is outside of the spasm window (day 16 post bleed) has had stable improvement in exam, and reassuring TCDs will liberalize her blood pressure goals and neurologic monitoring.   Dx:  - DSA (May 05) shows aneurysm 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.5 mm arising proximal to the origin of a Right M2 branch; repeat May 07 showed aneurysm clipped & stable; repeat May 13 showed absent to mild vasospasm in L anterior circulation   - TCD May 15 mild MCA spasm, May 14 mild MCA spasm, May 13 mild ***** spasm, May 19- Mild spasm in ***** *****   - q2h neuro checks (q4h overnight)  Tx:   - goal SBP *****-*****   - nimodipine x 21 days total (*****/*****-*****/*****).

Pain has been difficult to control despite escalating opiate doses and multimodal pain management strategies. While head and neck pain is common after SAH, current reports of pain have not improved even after receiving doses of pain medications. Possible component of perseveration regarding pain as a result of her R MCA territory involvement in addition to underlying pain. Additionally, has chart history of opiate use disorder; quit January
