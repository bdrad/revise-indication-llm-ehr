Right upper extremity positive for DVT, with thrombus visualized in the subclavian, axillary, and basilic veins. The innominate vein is questionable for slow flow versus thrombus. Proximal extent of thrombus is not visualized. CT scan of the chest with contrast is recommended for further evaluation of proximal extent of thrombus.

Expected evolutionary changes of right cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage centered in the right sylvian fissure. No new hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or herniation. 2.

EVD Removed May 19. Exam continuing to improve, with more function in ***** as of May 18. Post bleed day 17. Given that patient is outside of the spasm window (day 17 post bleed) has had stable improvement in exam, and reassuring TCDs will liberalize her blood pressure goals and neurologic monitoring.   Dx:  - DSA (May 05) shows aneurysm 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.5 mm arising proximal to the origin of a Right M2 branch; repeat May 07 showed aneurysm clipped & stable; repeat May 13 showed absent to mild vasospasm in L anterior circulation   - TCD May 15 mild MCA spasm, May 14 mild MCA spasm, May 13 mild ***** spasm, May 19-

Pain has been difficult to control despite escalating opiate doses and multimodal pain management strategies. While head and neck pain is common after SAH, current reports of pain have not improved even after receiving doses of pain medications. Possible component of perseveration regarding pain as a result of her R MCA territory involvement in addition to underlying pain. Additionally, has chart history of opiate use disorder; quit January 2022.

Intubated overnight May 12 given persistent desaturations; likely August 08 mucus plug in left lobe. Given mucomyst to break up bronchial plug. Repeat CXR showing improved tracheal shift, reduced opacity burden in L lung. Extubated on May 13 with ongoing 02 requirement of 4-6L.
