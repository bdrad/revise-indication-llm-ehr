SUBJECTIVE  ***** ***** ***** is a 65 y.o. female who presents with a known history of lung cancer.  From a lung cancer standpoint she is actually doing well and has no real symptoms to report.  She recovered a fall from a bicycle in ***** requiring surgical intervention to repair her left elbow.  She had the screw from her right arm recently removed and has been doing a great deal of PT to regain her range of motion which is gradually returning.  Otherwise the rest of her health has been excellent as always.  Despite the back injury she is been able to return to ***** ***** lifestyle including going back to the gym exercising, albeit with a little bit more caution now.  All in all she is doing great.    04/24/14,  her scans showed no evidence of disease and we planned to continue yearly screening with CT scan of the chest without contrast . She agreed to contact us in a few months to set up the scans prior to her visit which will be in April 2016. She continued to do extremely well, 12 yrs out from her resection. We discussed the option of discontinuing surveillance after 10 years of disease free scans.  She elected to continue with surveillance at this time indefinitely.     04/26/16, the patient presents for a follow up following her 04/22/16 Ct chest scan, which was essentially unremarkable, indicating no signs of disease recurrence. She 
 c/o of anxiety, paraesthesia, and GERD-like symptoms a few weeks ago, but they have resolved since then. She notes she recently retired and has been traveling extensively. She has an upcoming trip to ***** that she is excited about. Overall, and in line with her radiological status, the patient presents in excellent clinical condition, free of new issues or significant complaints. At this time, the patient is about 12 years out of her resection and continues to do excellently from a clinical standpoint. We continue to encourage the patient to stay active and contact her PCP for anxiety management and management of her shoulder problems.
