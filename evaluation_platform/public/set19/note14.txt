From a lung cancer standpoint she is actually doing well and has no real symptoms to report.  She recovered a fall from a bicycle in ***** requiring surgical intervention to repair her left elbow.  She had the screw from her right arm recently removed and has been doing a great deal of PT to regain her range of motion which is gradually returning.
