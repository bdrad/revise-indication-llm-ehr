Lab Review:     Component      Latest Ref Rng & Units 05/15/2017   Thyroid Stimulating Hormone      0.45 - 4.12 mIU/L 1.*****   ***** *****      10 - 18 pmol/L 13       US NECK/PARATHYROID/THYROID:  *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM    CLINICAL HISTORY:    thyroid nodule    COMPARISON: Chest CT 04/24/2017    TECHNIQUE: Sonographic evaluation of the lower and lateral neck bilaterally was performed in conjunction with Doppler imaging where appropriate.    FINDINGS: Right thyroid lobe measures 5.4 x 1.4 x 1.9 cm and left thyroid lobe measures 5.1 x 1.6 x 1.6 cm. Isthmus measures 0.2 cm.  Multiple bilateral benign-appearing colloid nodules are seen measuring up to 5 mm on the right thyroid and 1.2 cm in the left. No suspicious nodules. No suspicious lymph nodes are present.    IMPRESSION:     1. Several benign-appearing colloid nodules in both lobes of the thyroid measuring up to 1.2 cm in the left lobe. None of the nodules demonstrate suspicious features or meet criteria for biopsy. No suspicious lymphadenopathy.    END OF IMPRESSION:    05/23/2017 - Bedside Ultrasound Performed In-Office - attention to the thyroid lobes  Thyroid gland is ***** in size and slightly heterogenous.     Right lobe - Multiple small cystic nodules, one with a solid component, not suspicious. All nodules are benign appearing. The nodules are too small for intervention at this time.     Left lobe - Mutliple cystic nodules. The largest nodule with solid tissue 
 which is less than 50% of the nodule without suspicious findings. no indication for biopsy.     I also reviewed her chest CT in 2016 and 2017. The reported left nodule is indeed new.      Assessment:    In summary, ***** ***** ***** is a 64 y.o. female with thyroid nodules, incidentally found on chest CT in 2017.        Plan:    Thyroid nodules  I reviewed and discussed the results with the patient.  Most of the nodules are cystic and very small. The solid components in the few dominant nodules with solid components are not suspicious. FNA is not indicated at this time.     I suspect she has had the nodules all along and that CT scan did not pick up the small nodules because of resolution. The left dominant nodule was eventually visualized on CT because of either increased fluid component or bleeding (which is common), leading to enlargement.  For peace of mind, we will repeat ultrasound in 1 year.     I found the echotexture of the thyroid slightly heterogenous and this can a sign of underlying autoimmune thyroid disease. Given her normal TFT, no intervention is needed. I will repeat TFT in 1 year.     I discussed that her thyroid issues are unrelated to her parathyroid. She is to continue to follow up with Dr. *****.
