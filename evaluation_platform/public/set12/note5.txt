She does not remember the period of time that she was lying down but husband says she did not lose consciousness. Called 911. Symptoms resolved in ~30 minutes. CT, MRI done and negative. Carotid US with no plaque. By the time of discharge vision improved, symptoms resolved. Increased statin dose and added aspirin 81mg and discharged.     Today, double vision returned suddenly. Followed by nausea and vomiting. Reports mild headache behind R eye which is abnormal for her, improved with APAP from the ED. Sx resolved within about 30 min again today.

This means that the dizziness, nausea, blurry vision comes from the ear. Within the differential of transient neurological deficit we include stroke and seizure so we decided to keep you in the hospital to rule that out given that you have several risk factors. We do not think you had a stroke. You do have several risk factors for stroke including high cholesterol levels that we recommend you continue to talk about with your PCP. We do want you to come into the hospital if you have any other symptoms such as loss of vision, weakness, slurred/***** speech that could be a stroke. But, Based on our findings we recommend you continue to monitor your symptoms. We are ***** you a limited amount of medicine called meclizine that can be taken as needed if you have any of these episodes. We also recommend you look into vestibular training, talk about this with your PCP.     Major Medication Changes (please refer to your medication 
 list for detailed instructions):  Start   - Meclizine as needed for events of acute nausea/vomiting   Continue   - The rest of your medications as prescribed   - We do recommend atorvastatin 80mg based on your cholesterol levels   - Aspirin 81mg is not necessarily indicated; we recommend you take this if you have an indication for this or talk about it more with your PCP    Please go over the medication list with your nurse, and let them know if you have any questions.    Follow-up testing:  -You are being discharged home and we have not ordered additional testing at this time.    Follow-up appointments:    -We will not schedule neurology follow-up at this time but do recommend you see your primary care provider as below.    Outpatient Rehabilitation referrals (only for patients that are being discharged home):   - Not applicable; you are not being discharged home or you have no outpatient rehabilitation needs.  Recommended outpatient rehabilitation therapy: None       We also recommend that you follow up with your primary care provider.  If an appointment has not been made please make an appointment within 7 days from your discharge.    Education: we want all of our patients to know the warning signs of stroke. Look for weakness on one side, speech that doesn't make sense, slurred speech, feeling that the room is spinning, or unconsciousness. Call 911 immediately! Do not go to sleep or wait for the symptoms to get better; we can treat stroke if you arrive soon enough.

Transient Ischemic Attack 
 - A transient ischemic attack occurs when there is a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain which causes stroke symptoms that only last a short time but can be a warning sign of stroke.    Location of my stroke:         How to prevent stroke:  Risk factors that I can change:  High blood pressure (hypertension)  High cholesterol    My numbers and goals:  My recent blood pressure was:   Recent Blood Pressure   02/03/22 *****/*****      For most patients the target is less than 140/90, but for patients with diabetes or certain types of stroke, the target is less than 130/80.      For Ischemic stroke:  My recent LDL Cholesterol was:    Most patients should be treated with a cholesterol medication regardless of LDL, but a target of less than 70 mg/dl is reasonable for most patients.    Risk factors that I cannot change:   Increasing Age. ***** of all ages can have strokes, but the risk of stroke increases with age.   Sex. Strokes are more common in men than women, but more women die from stroke   *****/Ethnicity African Americans and Hispanic Americans have a higher risk of stroke than ***** Americans and whites.   Heredity. Your risk is higher if a close blood relative has had a stroke.      Recognizing a stroke: *****!  Call December 19-***** if you notice any of these stroke symptoms. Remember stroke is an emergency.
