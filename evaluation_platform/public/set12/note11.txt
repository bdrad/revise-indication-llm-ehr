The patient's blood pressure was 169 mmHg/856 mmHg during the study. Color Flow Doppler was utilized for this exam. Spectral Doppler was utilized for this exam.  1. The left ventricular volume is small. LV function is hyperdynamic. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 70 to 75%. There is no left ventricular hypertrophy. No segmental wall motion abnormalities present.  2. The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal. The RV S' is 15 cm/s.  3. Left atrial size is normal. Right atrial size is normal.  4. There is no hemodynamically significant valvular disease.  5. There is no Doppler evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction.  6. The RV systolic pressure is estimated to be 25 mmHg based on a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  7. No pericardial effusion noted. The inferior vena cava is less than 21 mm in diameter and collapses with inspiration consistent with a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  8. Aortic root dimension is normal.  9. No evidence of early or late 
 shunting was seen with right sided saline contrast administration.                  Previous Comparison:  No previous study is available for comparison.       Cardiac *****:  Left Ventricle: The left ventricular volume is small. LV function is hyperdynamic. LV ejection fraction is estimated to be 70 to 75%. There is no left ventricular hypertrophy. No segmental wall motion abnormalities present.  LV Diastolic Function: There is no Doppler evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction. Pulmonary venous flow is systolic predominant which is normal for the patient's age and consistent with normal LV filling pressures.  Right Ventricle: The right ventricular volume is normal. Right ventricular function is normal. The RV S' is 15 cm/s.  Left Atrium:Left atrial size is normal.  Right Atrium:Right atrial size is normal.  Cardiac output: Doppler findings are consistent with a high cardiac output.     Cardiac Valves:  Aortic Valve: The aortic valve is trileaflet. Trace aortic regurgitation is present.  Mitral Valve: The mitral valve anatomy and motion are normal. Trace / physiologic mitral regurgitation is present.  Tricuspid Valve: Tricuspid valve anatomy and motion are normal. There is trace tricuspid regurgitation.  Pulmonic Valve: Pulmonic valve anatomy and motion are normal. There is no pulmonic regurgitation.     Other:  Pulmonary Artery and Right Sided Pressures: The RV systolic pressure is estimated to be 25 mmHg based on a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  Aorta: Aortic root dimension is normal. The ascending aorta appears normal in size.  Pericardium: No pericardial effusion noted.  IVC and Hepatic Veins: The inferior vena cava is less than 21 mm in diameter and collapses with inspiration consistent with a right atrial pressure of 3 mmHg.  Other: ***** ***** was used to assess for shunt. No evidence of early or late shunting was seen with right sided saline contrast administration.     Measurements:    Variable
