VIDEO-EEG Daily Report

Patient Name: ***** *****

*****: *****

DOB: 01/14/1947)

Room/*****: *****/CDU-05

Attending / Referring Physician: ***** ***** *****, MD



OBJECT OF RECORDING: 75 y.o. female undergoing video-EEG 

monitoring in order to evaluate her symptoms of transient 

neurologic symptoms (double vision) to rule out focal seizures.  



STUDY START: 02/04/2022 at *****

***** *****: 02/04/2022 at 0829, recording complete



CONDITIONS OF RECORDING:

Recordings were obtained using a standard international February 06 

electrode placement in a 19-channel standard recording 

supplemented with a single electrocardiogram chest electrode. The 

recordings were obtained using a reference electrode and 

reformatted into bipolar montages for review. Concurrent 

continuous video recording was utilized. Throughout the entire 

monitoring evaluation, a video sitter (EEG technologist) observed 

the patient in real-time. The *****/***** spike and seizure 

detection computer program was used to screen the EEG. An 

epilepsy fellow and the attending neurologist reviewed the entire 

recording including *****. They also reviewed concurrent EEG 

and Video during episodes of interest.



FINDINGS - DAILY SUMMARIES AND DETAILED SEIZURE DATA: 

DAY 1: 02/04/2022 from 0059 to 0829

Relevant medications: No antiepileptic or general anesthetic 

medications. 

 Background: The waking background at rest is continuous, 

composed of an admixture of largely alpha and beta frequencies. 

The expected anterior-posterior voltage and frequency 

organization was present, with ***** faster frequencies 

anteriorly and a symmetric and well-formed posterior dominant 

alpha rhythm of 11 Hz that was reactive to eye opening. There 

were no interhemispheric asymmetries or areas of focal slowing.

 During sleep, there is the emergence of normal sleep 

architecture including vertex waves, symmetric and well-defined 

sleep spindles and K complexes.

 Interictal: No interictal epileptiform abnormalities.

 Ictal/push-button events: There are no electrographic or 

clinical seizures.







IMPRESSION: 

This continuous Video-EEG monitoring study was normal. There were 

no interhemispheric asymmetries, areas of focal slowing, 

epileptiform discharges or seizures.
