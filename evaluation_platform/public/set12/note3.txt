NEUROLOGY INITIAL CONSULT NOTE     Consult requested by attending Dr.  ***** from the ED service.    CC: Transient neurological symptoms     Interpreter Use Documentation  Preferred language: English  If non-English, interpreter modality: N/A - patient's preferred language is English  If interpreter used, document name/ID. If no interpreter used, specify why: N/A - patient's preferred language is English    History of Present Illness:  ***** ***** is a 75 y.o. woman with a history of HTN, HLD, rectum/anal staph infection, recurrent episodes of double vision, nausea, slurred speech, confusion with so far negative workup presenting with the same. Neurology was consulted for further workup/management .    Briefly, patient was initially admitted to ***** on February 02 for a ***** because of double vision, nausea, vomiting and slurred speech. MRI was negative but was sent home on ASA and statin. Then she re-presented with symptoms of the same 2 weeks later on January 2022 , symptoms resolved within 30 minutes. She was admitted for further ***** workup which had negative MRI.TTE was normal. EEG was normal as well. Given hearing loss, motion sickness, and tinnitus, this was thought maybe vestibular neuronitis more likely than a ***** so she was given meclizine at discharge.     Since discharge, husband and patient mention that after discharge she had recurrent of symptoms for about 4 days that were transient and they continued to be stereotypical. They since then had resolved and she went to see a neurologist at outside facility as well as ENT for the question of vestibular neuritis and she was told that this was likely not a ***** and it was also not likely vestibular neuritis.     Per chart review she was evaluated by Dr. ***** on February 2022 for this and he thought this could potentially be basilar artery migraine. Given that she has had at least 5 episodes of this and MRI without any acute findings, this is less likely *****.     Today, 
 she is presenting with the same ***** of double vision, nausea, slurred speech and headache/confusion for which we were consulted. This lasted for about 1 hour and patient napped after, she is back at baseline but she was urged by her family to come back to the ED. The episode today started as they were about to have breakfast. She started with double vision, then she becomes less responsive, still awake but does not answer all the questions, she didn't get nauseous as she went to lay down to abort the episode. Endorses mild slurred speech and they show me a video where she is describing horizontal triple diplopia but no nystagmus (there is shadowing along her left eye but eyes may be L>R diameter.     She had a mild nagging headache on the occipital area described as pressure but describes it very mild. She has chronic tinnitus and hearing loss that do not tend to be overwhelming during these episodes. She remembers most of the episode but not every detail. This lasted for about 1 hour.     Of note, she denies any daily headaches. She gets brain freeze and is very prone to motion sickness but she does not get ***** as she does not drink. She describes significant stressors revolving both episodes with the past month being worried about daughter with breast cancer who had dengue fever and *****. Then the last time she had these episodes in January she was worried about her daughter with newly diagnosed breast cancer.     Past Medical History:  No past medical history on file.

ASSESSMENT:  ***** ***** is a 75 y.o. 
 woman with a history of HTN, HLD, recurrent episodes of double vision, nausea, slurred speech, confusion with so far negative workup presenting with the same. Neurology was consulted for further workup/management.     History is notable for multiple vascular risk factors in the setting of recurrent episodes of double vision, nausea, slurred speech and confusion with negative workup including MRI brain x2, spot EEG without any acute findings. Vitals unremarkable. Labs unremarkable.     DDx for these constellation of symptoms could potentially localize to the brainstem given slurred speech, double vision, nausea and confusion. However, agree that given the recurrence of these episodes multiple times with negative MRIs, and vessels without any obvious culprit, this would be unusual. These are stereotypical episodes so the differential would include migraine versus seizure as most likely etiologies. Migraine higher on the differential given onset with headache and patient with migraine markers but otherwise no history of migraines. Seizures also high on the differential but previous routine eeg without increase risk and no clear trigger for decrease seizure threshold.     Recommend a step wise approach to her symptoms. Given multiple episodes, expect some sort of MRI change at this time. If negative, then I wouldn't call this a *****  Or consider this to be vascular in etiology. If symptoms reccur I actually recommend to treat this as a migraine with sumatriptan 50mg that can be prescribed at discharge. As soon as she gets the symptoms, recommend that she takes this to abort episode, if successful then this is our culprit. Can consider riboflavin/magnesium for ***** prevention. In terms of the seizure theory , this is certainly possible but given how sporadic events are, I wouldn't want to commit patient to AED, but if warranted can consider keppra 500mg BID.     This will require some trials, but for now if MRI negative and 
 symptoms are identical and don't change, then patient does not have to come to the ED if these symptoms reoccur.       Recommendations:  - Basic labs: met/tox/infectious workup   - MRI brain stroke focused stroke    If negative: patient can go home with Neurology follow up and prescribe sumatriptan 50mg at discharge to be taken if patient has ***** of symptoms (as soon as it starts). Patient should be counseled on avoiding headache triggers (sleep, stress, dehydration, etc.).   - Please place neurology referral at discharge        These recommendations were discussed verbally with Dr. ***** from the ED service. Please page *****-***** with any questions.     *****,  ***** ***** *****, MD  07/26/2022
