ED Attendings            ***** ***** *****, MD    History       Chief Complaint   Patient presents with    Headache     ***** from home dizziness, nausea, vomiting, double vision. Has been having similar symptoms over past week. Seen in ***** hospital Sunday with double vision, expressive aphasia, unsteady gait, transferred to ***** ***** for MRI which was neg, (no TPA). Reports last feeling normal 6 days ago. Pmh HTN, HLD, depression. Reports a lot of stress taking care of her daughter with cancer     ***** ***** (daughter) *****-*****-*****  ***** ***** (husband): *****-*****-*****    HPI  75F with HTN and HLD who presents with *****, double vision, nausea and vomiting.    Sunday morning (February 02), husband and daughter noticed that she was less responsive (she was kind of responding but not saying clear words), double vision, writing was not normal while she was sitting and having breakfast. They had her lie down and called ambulance but she does not remember this. She was taken to ***** ***** ***** (episode of emesis en route). Was doing better by the time of discharge (walking and vision improved). Per patient, they increased dose of statin from 20 to 40 and added ASA 81.     Upon my review of the outside records, the pt had NCHCT and MRI which were both neg acute and carotid ultrasound which showed no plaque.      This morning she felt a little slow but otherwise ok. Had some juice with meds and felt out of it. ***** vision returned (vertical double vision). ***** was concerned and called ambulance. Vomited once in ambulance and once here. Has headache in R frontal region and ache in the back of neck. She also had this yesterday morning (***** abated and returned). R eye feels achey, recently got new glasses. No difficulty swallowing.     Endorses feeling a little disoriented. Sx have been intermittent since they started. This morning she felt off balance, though yesterday at discharge she could walk fine. Tolerating PO. No 
 fevers, chills, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, *****, *****. No numbness, weakness, paresthesias.     Never had anything like this prior. Never had a migraine before. Doesn't get many headaches.    ***** going through chemo for breast cancer right now, so she spends a lot of time in ***** with daughter who is single mom.

Rapid alternating movements somewhat slowed bilaterally. ***** taps and foot taps fast but with slightly small amplitude. Normal FNF    Initial Assessment (problem list and differential diagnosis)     Ddx:  -*****  -Stroke (unlikely given recent negative imaging and waxing/waning sx)  -migraine (possible given constellation of sx but this should be dx of exclusion esp given that pt has never had migraine before)    Dx:  -CBC  -BMP  -Neuro consulted -> recommended MRI/MRA *****/Neck - focused stroke protocol     Tx:  -***** ***** and tylenol to manage *****            Interpretations:  Lab, Imaging, and ECG     CBC and BMP normal.    Reviewed imaging reports from outside hospital below:    NCHCT 02/01/22  PARENCHYMA: Pineal cystic-appearing region with peripheral calcifications measuring 7 mm in maximum diameter.        No acute intracranial hemorrhage, large territory vascular infarct or mass/mass effect.        Normal gray-***** matter differentiation.        Normal deep ***** matter.     CSF SPACES:        Mild enlargement of ventricles, cisterns and sulci.        No hydrocephalus.        No extra-axial collections.     BONES & SCALP:        No soft tissue swelling No skull fracture.        Normal as visualized globe and orbits.        Bilateral ethmoid sinus disease. Left sphenoid retention cyst/polyp.        Clear as visualized mastoids.     ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: None.       IMPRESSION:     1. No CT evidence for acute intracranial process.   2. Mild parenchymal volume loss.   3. Pineal cystic-appearing region with peripheral calcifications measuring 7 mm, likely benign and long-standing. Correlation with patient's history, clinical findings and comparison to prior studies if available would be 
 helpful.      MRI 02/01/22    FINDINGS: Ventricles and sulci are within normal limits. There is no acute infarction. No intracranial hemorrhage or extra-axial fluid collection is identified. There is mild to moderate periventricular and subcortical ***** matter T2 FLAIR hyperintensity. No masses are identified. Posterior fossa, brainstem and cervical medullary junction are unremarkable. Normal intravascular flow voids are identified. Orbits, periorbital and ***** spaces are unremarkable. Mucosal disease is noted in the ethmoid sinuses. Osseous structures are unremarkable.       IMPRESSION:     No acute intracranial pathology. Mild to moderate chronic microvascular ischemic changes.     02/02/22 Carotid ultrasound    FINDINGS:   RIGHT SIDE:  Peak Velocity (cm/sec)   ***** peak systolic: 67       end diastolic:   CCA peak systolic: 93       end diastolic:     ECA peak systolic:         Systolic *****/***** ratio: 0.7   Vertebral artery: Antegrade           Subclavian artery:   Estimated visible diameter stenosis:   Plaque characteristics:     LEFT SIDE: Peak Velocity (cm/sec)   ***** peak systolic: 63      end diastolic:   CCA peak systolic: 94      end diastolic:   ECA peak systolic:   Systolic *****/***** ratio: 0.7   Vertebral artery: Antegrade   Subclavian artery:   Estimated visible diameter stenosis:   Plaque characteristics:     COMMENTS:     RIGHT CAROTID/VERTEBRAL ARTERIES: The study is of satisfactory quality. There is no significant atherosclerotic plaquing in any portion of the common, internal or external carotid arteries visualized. There are no elevated peak systolic velocities, and velocity ratios are within normal limits. No spectral broadening is seen to suggest turbulence.     Antegrade vertebral artery flow on the right is identified. .     LEFT CAROTID/VERTEBRAL ARTERIES: The study is of satisfactory quality. There is no 
 significant atherosclerotic plaquing in any portion of the common, internal or external carotid arteries visualized. There are no elevated peak systolic velocities, and velocity ratios are within normal limits. No spectral broadening is seen to suggest turbulence.     Antegrade vertebral artery flow on the left is identified.       Reassessment and Final Disposition     ED Disposition: Data Unavailable  Clinical Impression:      75F HTN HLD p/w recurrent double vision, n/v after similar episode 2 days ago with normal NCHCT, MRI, carotid US at ***** c/f vertebrobasilar ***** vs migraine.     Given that presentation could be consistent with vertebrobasilar ***** but vessels were not imaged at *****, neurology recommending MRI brain, MRA brain, MRA neck without contrast, focused stroke protocol.     Patient signed out to oncoming team.    [ ] follow up MRI/MRA   [ ] follow up neuro recs    If not convincing for *****, likely migraine and would treat sx with migraine cocktail.
