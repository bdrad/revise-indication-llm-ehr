 duct stent and cholecystoduodenostomy catheter.  2.  New moderate volume ascites. Although patient has known cavernous malformation in the portal vein with severe narrowing of the portal mesenteric confluence, given a new right hepatic lobe bile duct which extends to irregularity along the hepatic capsule (series 3, image 63), ***** new ascites related to bile. Paracentesis and fluid sampling could help further evaluate.   3.  Decreased conspicuity of previously seen peripherally enhancing focus in segment 4A on this single phase-contrast study.  4.  Persistent atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail with foci of gas.  5.  Nonspecific segmental thickening of the sigmoid colon and ascending colon which may be reactive or related to colitis.  6.

F/t/h Strep bacteremia at ***** thought to be biliary in source, discharged with PICC and penicillin 2 days ago. On arrival, afebrile, WBC wnl. Suspect biliary source as above vs less likely SBP without peritonitic signs. Fevers have been on and off for years, suspect partially due to malignancy.
