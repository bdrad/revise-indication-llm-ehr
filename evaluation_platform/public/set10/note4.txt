Medical Decision Making           Medical Decision Making  ***** ***** is a 72 y.o. old female, with RCC s/p R nephrectomy w/ recurrence to R adrenal, liver and pancreas, c/b malignant ***** obstruction s/p CBD stent, recent admission for cholecystitis s/p cholecystoduodenostomy (s/p ***** removal, replaced w/ double pigtail stent 11/05/22) w/ December 2022 ucsf admission for acute on chronic abdominal pain, n/v, and fevers w/ imaging c/f growing malignant duodenal ulcer, s/p EGD January 19 with stent exchange removal biliary sludge, and biopsy of ulcer. Per chart, subsequently recent OSH hospitalization in March w/ strep 
 bacteremia, unclear source who presents with fevers and chills, abdominal pain, N/V.  Vital signs notable for low-grade fever.  No acute distress.  Exam as above.  Differential diagnosis: Consider bacteremia versus intra-abdominal infection versus biliary stent malfunction versus bile leak, consider pancreatitis versus enteritis versus colitis, low concern for small bowel obstruction given patient having normal bowel movements.  Consider ***** versus ***** versus pneumonia given productive cough.  Less likely urinary tract infection given no reported urinary symptoms.    Plan: Labs, urinalysis, CT abdomen pelvis with contrast, Zofran, admit    Problems Addressed:  Dilation of biliary tract: complicated acute illness or injury  Fever, unspecified fever cause: complicated acute illness or injury  Other ascites: complicated acute illness or injury    Amount and/or Complexity of Data Reviewed  Labs: ordered.

No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.     Normal cardiomediastinal silhouette.     Right upper extremity PICC line with tip terminating in the right atrium.     0325 CTAP    1.  Compared to 02/21/2023, worsening right hepatic lobe intrahepatic biliary dilation with associated loss of pneumobilia, concerning for inadequate biliary drainage. Unchanged metallic common bile duct stent and cholecystoduodenostomy catheter.  2.  New moderate volume 
 ascites. Although patient has known cavernous malformation in the portal vein with severe narrowing of the portal mesenteric confluence, given a new right hepatic lobe bile duct which extends to irregularity along the hepatic capsule (series 3, image 63), ***** new ascites related to bile. Paracentesis and fluid sampling could help further evaluate.   3.  Decreased conspicuity of previously seen peripherally enhancing focus in segment 4A on this single phase-contrast study.  4.  Persistent atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail with foci of gas.  5.  Nonspecific segmental thickening of the sigmoid colon and ascending colon which may be reactive or related to colitis.  6.  Status post right nephrectomy and adrenalectomy. New left hydronephrosis.  7.  Similar partially imaged lingular 1.1 cm pulmonary nodule. New bilateral trace ascites.     0407 POCUS - no drainable fluid pocket for para   0407 Paged MOD for admission   0427 Pt admitted to medicine, sign out given.         ***** *****, MD  Resident  04/09/23 0720       ***** ***** *****, MD  04/10/23 2327
