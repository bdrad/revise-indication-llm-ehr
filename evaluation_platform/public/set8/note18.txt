He was treated with primary chemoradiation at *****.     Chemoradiation 70 Gy with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 x 5 completed 12/23/2020.      Imaging studies:  CT NECK WITH CONTRAST:  10/03/2021     INDICATION (as provided by referring clinician): Cancer surveillance (no evidence of disease, no new symptoms)  Neck or C-spine malignant neoplasm care    ADDITIONAL HISTORY: never smoker diagnosed on 08/29/2020 with squamous cell carcinoma of the right base of tongue ***** ***** Stage III, s/p chemoradiation 70 Gy with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2 x 5 completed 12/23/2020.    COMPARISON: PET/CT 
 03/20/2021.    TECHNIQUE: Helical CT imaging of the neck with coronal and sagittal reformatted images.    MEDICATIONS:  Iohexol 350 - 119 mL - Intravenous    RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS:  ***** *****: 4 , CTDIvol Min: 8.1 mGy, CTDIvol Max: 8.3 mGy, DLP: 622.2 mGy.cm. The following accession numbers are related to this dose report *****,*****    FINDINGS:    Posttreatment changes with mild asymmetry of the base of tongue. No evidence of discrete mass. Evolution of postradiation changes including submucosal edema, subcutaneous stranding and skin platysma thickening.     Residual centrally necrotic right level IIb lymph node measures approximately 8 x 5 mm (series 8 image 139), similar to PET/CT 03/20/2021 and decreased from pretreatment CT neck of 09/27/2020.    Cervical carotid and vertebral arteries are patent. Internal jugular veins are patent without thrombosis. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions within the cervical spine or skull base.     IMPRESSION:     1.  Posttreatment changes without evidence of residual primary mass at the right base of tongue.    2.  Residual centrally necrotic right level IIb lymph node measures 8 x 5 mm, unchanged in size from prior PET/CT 03/27/2021 where it was not hypermetabolic. Continued attention on follow-up.

RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS:  ***** *****: 4 , CTDIvol Min: 8.1 mGy, CTDIvol Max: 8.3 mGy, DLP: 622.2 mGy.cm. The following accession numbers are related to this dose report *****,*****    FINDINGS:    LUNGS:  3 mm peripheral left lower 
 lobe nodule (series 7 image 393).   Scattered calcified granulomas likely sequela of prior granulomatous disease.     PLEURA:  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.    MEDIASTINUM:   No suspicious mediastinal lymphadenopathy.    HEART/***** *****:  Normal heart size. Normal caliber thoracic aorta and main pulmonary artery. Mild coronary artery calcifications. No pericardial effusion.     BONES/SOFT TISSUES:  No suspicious osseous lesions.  Please refer to dedicated CT neck report.    VISIBLE ABDOMEN:  Multiple subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities are too small to characterize. Partially visualized right renal cyst. Limited views of the upper abdomen is otherwise unremarkable.    IMPRESSION:   3 mm peripheral left lower lobe nodule is indeterminant for malignancy. Recommend attention on follow-up imaging. No suspicious osseous lesions.    Report dictated by: ***** ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** ***** *****, MD  Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging      PET/CT Whole Body (vertex to thighs)    03/20/2021      COMPARISON (including at least the prior year or since last change in therapy): PET/CT 09/27/2020    REASON FOR THE STUDY: Restaging.     FINDINGS:    Reference standardized uptake values:  Current exam: Cerebellar ***** is 11.6.   Prior cerebellar SUV max: 11.0    Oncologic Findings:    Index lesions:  1.  Tumor arising from the right base of tongue is no longer definitely seen and demonstrates complete interval resolution of previously seen hypermetabolism.    2.  Right level II cervical lymph node: Marked interval decrease in size, now measuring 5 mm in the short axis (series 8, image 114), and demonstrating complete interval resolution of previously seen hypermetabolism, previously measuring up to 2.9 cm with an SUV ***** of 17.5.    Lymph nodes: No hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy.  Lungs: No metastases.  Abdominal and pelvic organs: No metastases.  Bones: No metastases.  Other: No 
 metastases.    Non-oncologic findings:    Brain: Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum. No mass effect. While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated.    Neck: Otherwise unremarkable.    Chest: Otherwise unremarkable.    Abdomen/Pelvis: Appropriately positioned percutaneous gastrostomy tube. Unchanged right renal cyst measuring up to 2.3 cm. Otherwise unremarkable.    Musculoskeletal: Otherwise unremarkable.    IMPRESSION:     Compared to 09/27/2020, complete interval resolution of hypermetabolism previously associated with the right base of tongue tumor. Interval resolution of right level II cervical nodal metastatic lymphadenopathy. No evidence of residual or recurrent disease.      MR FACE, NASO, NECK WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  02/20/2021  IMPRESSION:   Since 10/09/2020, evidence of treatment response, with no appreciable base of tongue mass and decreased size of bilateral cervical lymph nodes.

This is a shared visit for services provided by me, ***** *****. *****, MD. I performed a face-to-face encounter with the patient and the following portion of the note is my own.           Procedure performed:   Flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy (***** *****: *****):   Medical necessity/Indication: base of tongue cancer  Needed full, in depth, and close up view of upper aerodigestive tract.     After obtaining informed consent from the patient, 4% lidocaine was sprayed in both nasal cavities.  I advanced the endoscope into the right and left nasal cavity.  The patient had a normal nasal cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.  The patient had normal bilateral symmetrical vocal cord movement.  
 The patient had normal inferior tonsillar fossae, vallecula, epiglottis, laryngeal epiglottis, ***** folds, arytenoids, false vocal cords, true vocal cords, piriform sinus, piriform sinus apices, posterior cricoid area, and posterior pharyngeal walls. Bilateral base of tongue now free of tumor; there is normal mucosa.        ASSESSMENT  Currently no evidence of disease.
