 sleep study on 10/22/2004at our sleep center.   The Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) = 16  Oxygen desaturation nadir to 84%.    I personally reviewed and interpreted the CPAP data download:  Respironics CPAP download date range: 04/05/2022 - 05/04/2022  Average Usage (Days Used):  7 hrs. 14 mins. 25 secs.   Percent of Days with Usage >= 4 Hours: 93.3%  Pressure range prescribed:  January 08  Auto CPAP Mean Pressure:   10.4 *****  Auto CPAP Peak Average Pressure:  13.4 *****  Average Device Pressure <= 90% of Time: 14.2 *****  Average Time in Large ***** Per Day: 1 hrs. 23 mins. 46 secs   Average AHI: 2.2    ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:    1. Moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea.  The patient is doing well on CPAP , with good compliance and improvement in ***** symptoms.  He is ***** from *****  therapy.      I went over the CPAP download in detail with the patient.  The AHI is normal on the current settings, no adjustment is recommended at this time.    Patient has a ***** ***** 1 Auto CPAP which is a recalled machine, patient has registered his machine on ***** website but has not received a replacement yet. Patient informed that if his machine is <5 years old, he will likely need to get the replacement from *****. If patient does not receive his replacement CPAP in 3 months, a prescription for a new CPAP unit will be ordered, he got his current machine on May 05,2017.     We discussed also if you have moderate or severe apnea, or are getting significant benefit from *****, and also not seeing any grey dust or particles (from the foam) in your tubing or mask, it is reasonable to continue using the unit until it can be replaced.  But if you prefer to be cautious for now, then please go off treatment.    Longterm treatment is medically indicated, due to the risk of morbidity, sleepiness, hypertension, and CHF. The patient was told not to drive if drowsy.    2. History of malignant neoplasm of base of tongue, s/p 
 chemo-radiation therapy - December 2020.    Planned follow up:     Since insurance requires a brief annual note regarding OSA and CPAP, the patient should continue annual follow-up with PCP to obtain that brief note when CPAP is going smoothly. At annual physical, the PCP clinic note can briefly state "good compliance on CPAP with improvement in symptoms of OSA symptoms, therefore long-term CPAP is medically indicated." If patient needs prescription for supplies, it can be written on any RX pad for "CPAP mask and all supplies. Patient preference." If patient is having new clinical issues, the patient should return to ***** ***** for reassessment.
