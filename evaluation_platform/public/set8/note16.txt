UCSF Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery  Speech Language Pathology  Clinical ***** Evaluation & Videofluoroscopic ***** Study    History: ***** ***** is a 66 y.o. male with history of a ***** of the right base of tongue and iss/p chemoradiation 70 Gy with weekly ***** the base of tongue and bilateral neck completed *****/*****/*****. He had poor nutrition due to dysgeusia, nausea and odynophagia. ***** feeding tube was placed on November 29 and transitioned to PEG on December 10.    ***** on 03/07/2021: "improving oropharyngeal dysphagia. He demonstrates reduced bolus flow through the pharynx which is likely due to reduced bilateral ***** retraction and pharyngeal contraction. This causes him to have trace to mild residue with thin liquid and moderate to severe residue with puree solids and soft chopped solids in the vallecula and *****. Multiple ***** were not successful in completely clearing the residue. He benefited from a liquid wash to clear the puree residue and a chin ***** with liquid wash to clear the soft chopped solids. No aspiration was noted with any consistency. He did have one instance of immediate coughing after the first trial of thin which may have been in response to penetration or aspiration however to residue was seen in the laryngeal vestibule. He was encouraged to begin liquidized solids and thin liquid and to increase oral intake. We will continue with therapeutic trials of puree solids".    ***** on 04/29/2021: "moderate pharyngeal dysphagia; however today's ***** demonstrates safe swallowing function with regard to aspiration, suggesting he could maintain a trajectory toward reducing to eliminating feeding tube use over a period of weeks"     ***** on 08/06/2021: "mildly unsafe and mildly inefficient pharyngeal swallow with a decline in hyolaryngeal displacement kinematics compared to baseline, although at both time points >2 SD from the norm. This kinematic reduction, in addition 
 to reduced driving force from tongue base, contributed to a collection of residue at the tongue base, but much improved compared to 3 months post CRT exam. There were similar patterns of penetration into the vestibule with thin liquid, but no aspiration this exam compared to baseline, with consistent penetration above level of ***** in 3 of 4 trials. This appeared secondary to perhaps a change in sensory input with the bolus reaching the pyriforms and then penetrating into the vestibule at the onset of the swallow. However even in task challenge, no aspiration. Clinically, he appeared to have an inhale swallow exhale pattern. With a shift to exhale swallow exhale, he noted "*****" in swallow, although unsure how this changed functional or physiologic outcomes given not tested under *****"     S: He reports that swallowing feels normal. He is eating regular solids and thin liquid. He doesn't have to think when he is swallowing. He is not avoiding any foods. Some foods like salads take longer but he is back to eating salads and other raw vegetables. Every once and while when he swallows a capsule it will feel like it sticks. He continues with his exercises. He is doing neck stretching, ***** and stretches, lingual ROM. He is not doing bolus driven therapy as much these days. He thinks perhaps that is how he swallows now. He is doing the masako but it is sporadically throughout the day. He denies coughing, choking, the sensation of pharyngeal residue or increased effort with swallowing. His dry mouth is improving. ***** continues to be different. He continues with MLD and compression but is not doing it every day. His lymphedema has improved.

O:   Perceptual Head & Neck, Speech, and Voice Evaluation was performed to objectively monitor 
 cervical and neck range of motion, jaw range of motion, tongue strength, and salivary production, revealing:   Cervical ROM:Not assessed.

Other pertinent findings:none    Clinical ***** Evaluation was completed with thin liquid revealing and puree solids:   Complete anterior oral bolus containment    Laryngeal ascent was present during perceived swallowing gesture   No overt signs or symptoms of penetration or aspiration (e.g., cough, throat clear, & wet voice quality)   Other pertinent findings    Dynamic ***** Study: ***** ***** was used taped to the patient's neck and used as a 19.05 mm calibration measurement marker.  The patient was presented with nectar thick liquid single barium sips for Dynamic ***** Study performance and interpretation to objectively quantify swallowing kinematics, to compare to normative data, and to assess aspiration risk. Please see "Swallowing Evaluation" in the attached flowsheet for results.      Videofluoroscopic ***** Study was performed to assess swallowing kinematics. Patient was presented with ***** thin liquid, ***** mildly thick, ***** paste, ***** cracker  and tablet + thin liquid.  Visualization was assessed in the lateral and A-P planes.

 anatomy and physiology of the voice and swallowing mechanism.   Counseled the patient on expected speech and swallowing anatomic and physiologic changes following their planned oncologic intervention.   Educated the patient on the role of speech-pathology to monitor and assess oral motor physiology, and to improve speech and swallowing function as appropriate   Provided counseling on the range of acute and late effects sequelae to chemo and radiation therapy, including: dysgeusia, mucositis, xerostomia, and fibrosis.  Supplied handouts on management options to improve these symptoms.   Self-awareness and discrimination were targeted throughout the session.    Impressions: ***** *****, 67 y.o. male with a medical history of ***** of the right base of tongue and iss/p chemoradiation 70 Gy with weekly ***** the base of tongue and bilateral neck completed *****/*****/*****. He had poor nutrition due to dysgeusia, nausea and odynophagia and a PEG was placed on 12/09/20.    Today he reports that his swallowing feels normal. He has resumed his baseline diet of regular solids and thin liquid and reports that he no longer needs to think about swallowing as he is eating.  The results of this evaluation support the patient report as I see only mildly reduced safety and efficiency due primarily to mildly reduced pharyngeal constriction and base-of-tongue retraction with a slightly reduced pharyngeal stripping wave. He compensated well for resulting residue by employing multiple swallows. He should continue with his pharyngeal strengthening exercises and follow up as scheduled with ***** for therapy.
