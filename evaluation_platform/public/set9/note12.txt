THORACIC MED ONC MB 6 - Progress Notes (Physician) | 2023-06-11 00:00:00
I performed this consultation using real-time Telehealth tools, including a live video connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating the consultation, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this consultation using Telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the Telehealth interaction.    Subjective:     IDENTIFICATION: 70 y.o. female with a history of bilateral lung transplant in 2017 for COPD, now with new diagnosis of stage IV NSCLC here for follow up.     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  -02/07/2017: Lung transplant for COPD  -02/09/2021 High resolution CT chest: No evidence for rejection or infection   -02/23/2022 High resolution CT chest: Status post bilateral lung transplantation.Increasing focal subpleural consolidation in the paramediastinal left upper lobe (series September 36), which may reflect a focal atelectasis. Attention on follow-up. No definite evidence of infection or acute rejection.  -03/08/2023 High resolution CT chest: Increase in size of infiltrative soft tissue along the left superior mediastinal border, concerning for malignancy. There is associated left greater than right nodular pleural thickening and a new small left pleural effusion concerning for pleural malignancy. Right pericardiophrenic lymphadenopathy is also present. New clustered nodules in the bilateral upper lobes and superior segment of the left lower lobe which may reflect infection or rejection. New lytic and sclerotic lesions in the upper thoracic spine, also suspicious for malignancy. New severe compression deformity of L1.   -03/22/2023 PET/CT: Hypermetabolic soft tissue along the left superior mediastinal border involving the medial left upper and left lower lobes, concerning for a primary malignancy. Associated loculated left and right pleural effusions with nodular pleural thickening/enhancement and a hypermetabolic T5 vertebral body lesion, concerning for metastatic disease. Low level 
 avidity of the proximal left femur likely represents a site of prior injury.  Recommend correlation with patient history.   -04/20/2023 CT-guided biopsy of T5 lesion                 Path: metastatic carcinoma, favor lung origin                 IHC: *****+, CK7+, TTF-1+, GATA3 patchy+, ***** neg, ***** neg, ***** neg                 ***** no pathogenic alterations. TMB 11.0 *****/mb.                  PD-L1 0%    INTERVAL HISTORY:    [] *****  [] another biopsy?   [] MRI brain June 15   [] ?repeat scans?     -Patient presents today with *****.    ***** is here with her son ***** to establish care with oncology. She is still coping and adjusting to their diagnosis. She is largely asymptomatic so this has all come as a shock. She does have an occasional cough productive of phlegm. She had noticed a slight decline in her breathing over the last few months, but this was fairly subtle. Her main complaint is severe pain in her mid-back at the site of the T5 metastasis. She occasionally needs oxycodone, it helps take the edge off. She also had CBD/THC ***** as well. Quit smoking 15 years ago, hasn't had a drink or smoke since then. She had also lost 75 lbs over a few years. Some of this was intentional, she had been trying to lose weight. She has a history of several skin cancers that have all been removed surgically. She was ***** at ***** for 9 months before the lung transplant; she sees it as a ***** that she survived. She has had a few complications and issues over the years since then but has a very strong will to keep going. Most recent problem was an arm infection this past October. She has some lingering left hip pain. Discussed at length that although she has a strong will to live, quality of life is very important. She does not want treatment to be worse than the disease. If her time were limited, she would want to be with family and not in the hospital.      Lung Transplant Pulmonologist: ***** *****

Imaging result in interval history above.     Assessment:     Impression: 70 y.o. female with     #Supportive care:    Advance care planning  {amb ucsf adv dir has/has *****:*****}    RTC *****    The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient's 
 satisfaction.    Below for billing only  I spent a total of ***** minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes face-to-face time with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    Medical decision making:  Problems: patient's active cancer represents a life-threatening illness  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: high; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities    I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, I obtained informed verbal consent to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools and answered all the questions about the telehealth interaction. My location is not in a UCSF clinical facility.
