Assessment:  ***** ***** is a 70 y.o. year-old female with history of bilateral lung transplant with de ***** metastatic NSCLC, not currently on systemic therapy  with biopsy proven metastasis at T5 that 
 is causing pain here to discuss palliative radiation.     We discussed the benefits, risks, and alternatives of palliative radiation therapy for bone metastasis. Multiple trials have shown at least partial pain relief in 60-70% of patients and complete pain relief in 15-20% of patients whether single or multiple fraction regimens are used (***** Clin ***** 2012). Maximum pain relief typically occurs after 4-6 weeks. The frequency of retreatment with single fraction regimens is approximately 20% versus 10% with a multifraction regimen (***** ***** 2005). In her case we favor 5 fraction IMRT    Side effects of palliative radiation therapy are typically mild and temporary, with the most likely from treatment in this area being fatigue. A minority of patients may experience a transient pain flare in the treated area, typically within one week of starting radiation therapy (***** IJROBP 2009). Long term side effects are uncommon, but we discussed weakening of the bone. Alternatives include no treatment, systemic analgesics, or local analgesia such as patches and nerve blocks.     She was given ample opportunity to ask questions, which were all answered to her satisfaction. After discussion, she would like to proceed with palliative radiation therapy as outlined above.     Plan:  [1] RT auth for IMRT 5 fraction every day to T5 metastatic disease  [2] CT simulation  [3] Discuss with Dr. *****  [4] Social work referral for housing    ***** *****, MD, PhD  Resident Physician  Department of ***** *****  ***** of *****, ***** *****    ATTESTATION:    My date of service is 06/12/2023. I was present for and performed key portions of an examination of the patient.  I am personally involved in the management of the patient and have independently reviewed and interpreted imaging and pathology as ***** to this case. I agree with the findings and care plans as documented.     ***** ***** MD,
