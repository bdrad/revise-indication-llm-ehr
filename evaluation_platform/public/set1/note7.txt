Hi *****, ***** did great with botox today (70 units in the left FCR, 100 units in the left FDS (at 2 sites), and 10 units in thumb).   Mom did note she is currently not getting any OT, PT, or SLP and interested in all 3. OT needs new orders post botox. PT concerns related to balance. SLP concerns related to drooling primarily. She would need new orders for all 3 if you think appropriated to place in *****. ***** in included. *****,   *****
