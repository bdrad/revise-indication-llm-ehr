Kindly refer to my attached progress note for more details.

She was first diagnosed in July 2019 with persistent headaches and double vision. MRI demonstrated a right temporoparietal mass encasing branches of the right MCA *****. She underwent a gross total resection with minimal residual adherent to the M2 branch. Pathology was consistent with anaplastic astrocytoma.    She underwent radiation therapy at ***** with 59.4 Gy. This was completed in October 2019. She was then noted to have progression and recurrence in May 2020  with vascular compromise and underwent re-resection of a large tumor progression. This was done with the intent of bypassing the area of MCA encasement with Neurovascular Surgery. However, the encasement now involved multiple branches of the MCA trifurcation and the configuration was not able to be ***** by a donor, but rather we were able to have the vessels skeletonized extensively and treated with local peroxide.    She was then followed by Radiation at ***** at ***** ***** with 40 Gy boost to the mesial enhancing portion that was unable to be ***** or resected. Her subsequent at ***** demonstrated a ***** and ***** deletions as well as a ***** fusion.  Currently, she is status post ***** ***** treatment; however, she has an large area of recurrence, seemingly at the area of the MCA trifurcation. She had an angiogram 11/25/2021 and selective ***** did not elicit a paralysis of the M2 branch but 
 rather SSEP changes.     She was taken to the OR for resection possible bypass- clamping of the feeding artery did not result NIM changes until 12 in after the artery was taking and SSEP was lost but motors maintained.  So after the main encased portion was removed additional suspicious areas were resected and 8 negative frozen sections were taken to ensure margins.  However I MRI ***** an area of suspicious residual and we went back and took the out, ***** read of  of that however , was also  negative.    She did have a post opt hemi and an area of diffusion restriction at the posterior edge of the internal capsule,     Interval History    03/31/22: the patient reports feeling well.
