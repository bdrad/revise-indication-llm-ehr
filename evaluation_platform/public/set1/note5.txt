PED NEURO ONC MB - Progress Notes (Physician) | 2022-10-28 00:00:00
UCSF PEDIATRIC NEURO-ONCOLOGY NOTE:     DATE OF VISIT:  10/28/2022     PATIENT ID:  ***** ***** is a 10 y.o. female who presents accompanied by both parents for follow up evaluation of recurrent ependymoma.  No interpreter was utilized.    CHIEF COMPLAINT: left-sided weakness  TREATMENT PROTOCOL: everolimus and ribociclib   DATE OF THERAPY START:  12/23/2021 (everolimus) 01/01/22 (ribociclib)  VISIT:  Month 10    CC: weakness (improving)    Last visit:03/26/2022      History of Present Illness:  ***** is a now 10 y.o. 11 m.o. female with history of parietal anaplastic ependymoma.  She was first diagnosed in July 2019, after presenting with 1 month of persistent R frontal headaches, double vision, emesis, and ***** weakness. MRI showed a R frontal mass encasing branches of the R MCA, with calcification and vasogenic edema. She underwent uncomplicated subtotal resection at ***** on 08/02/2019 (Dr. *****), with a small residual portion adherent to the ***** branch of the MCA. Pathology was consistent with anaplastic ependymoma; ***** was requested but was denied by insurance even on appeal. ***** subsequently underwent radiation therapy at *****. *****'s in *****, *****, with 59.4Gy over 33 fractions, completed on 11/09/2019. She was then followed by surveillance MRI.     In May 2020, she was noted to have progression of the residual lesion; surgery was planned for 07/24/2020 at *****. However, on July 23, patient developed acute onset distal L side weakness, facial weakness, and dysarthria, and presented to our ED. Code stroke was called, imaging obtained, and Neurology evaluated as most c/w ***** due to tumor progression. ***** to ***** on July 24 with Neurosurgery (Dr/ Sun), Neuro-IR, and Neuro-Vascular surgery, for craniotomy, intraoperative IR angiogram, intraoperative extra-to intracranial-vascular bypass, and tumor resection. Procedure was reportedly without complication but given the involvement of at least 3 branches of the MCA, a 
 bypass was not done and it was felt that some disease was likely left behind.  ***** recovered well from surgery and has ***** weakness or numbness with left side.     On 08/28/2020 her interval MRI had improved and so we moved forward with re-irradiation at ***** which she has also completed on 10/16/2020- s/p 35 Gy x 10 fractions + 40 Gy boost to medial enhancing portion. She tolerated RT well with no significant complications, had some mild fatigue and intermittent ***** in R frontal area that was transient and infrequent.      ***** revealed ***** and ***** deletions, ***** mutation, and known ***** fusion. I have previously discussed with *****'s parents that one recent study found that ***** deletion in the setting of *****-fusion + ependymoma was associated with a higher risk of recurrence.  We have also discussed available experimental treatment options.      ***** was enrolled in the ***** Brain Child-01 *****-T trial in March 2021.  She received intra-Ommaya and/or LP treatment weekly for a total of 6 cycles through July 2021.  Follow up MRI on 09/05/21 was concerning for tumor progression and she came off of study.      ***** underwent repeat surgical resection by Dr. ***** on 11/28/21. Complete surgical resection was achieved.  As anticipated, ***** had left hemiparesis after surgery.  She underwent inpatient rehab after recovering from surgery and made excellent progress, although remained weak on her left side distal > proximal. Ongoing PT/OT. Outpatient therapies started. ***** started planned therapy while in the hospital on Apri.4, 2022 and now is taking both everolimus and ribociclib.      INTERVAL HISTORY:  ***** returns with parents today for follow up. Overall she is doing quite well. She continues to take ribociclib and everolimus as prescribed and tolerates well.  This is being managed by Dr. ***** ***** and his team in *****, *****.   Her left-sided weakness continues to improve. She 
 previously had some dysautonomia that will effect the left upper extremity, the arm will get blue and cold. This was not brought up today. Her gait has quicken and she is playing sports at school. She goes to OT in *****, ***** every Friday.  She was previously discharged from ***** but she continues OT for fine motor with hand. She denies recent headaches.

IMAGING:       I personally reviewed and interpreted MRI below and compared to several priors including most recent.  I reviewed the MRI with the patient's family.  There is decreased resection cavity; no radiographic evidence for tumor recurrence.     MR BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM    INDICATION (as provided by 
 referring clinician): Brain neoplasm (known or suspected)  patient with multiply recurrent ependymoma, please see priors    ADDITIONAL HISTORY: 10 yo F with history of recurrent parietal *****-fusion anaplastic ependymoma. She ***** tumor resection by Dr. ***** in November 2021 with anticipate left-hemiparesis due to goal of complete resection. She is currently on everolimus and ribociclib, tolerating well , with only mild neutropenia. She is currently in third cycle.    COMPARISON: MR brain 06/25/2022.    TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences through the brain were acquired at 3.0 tesla.    MEDICATIONS:  Dotarem - 6.64 mL - Intravenous    FINDINGS:    Similar postsurgical changes related to right parietal craniotomy with underlying resection cavity in the right temporal parietal lobe. Unchanged thin linear enhancement surrounding the resection cavity. Surrounding FLAIR hyperintensity is unchanged.    Scattered foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the white matter are unchanged.    Trace right holohemispheric extra-axial fluid collection is unchanged. Susceptibility artifact from vascular clip.    Unchanged ventricular configuration with ex vacuo dilatation of the right temporal horn.    No acute hemorrhage, infarct, or herniation.    IMPRESSION:     Compared to 06/25/2022, no evidence of disease progression.     Report dictated by: ***** *****-***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** ***** *****, MD  Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging         Assessment/Plan     ***** is a nearly 11 yo F with history of multiply recurrent parietal *****-fusion anaplastic ependymoma.  She underwent repeat tumor resection by Dr. ***** in November 2021 with anticipate left-hemiparesis due to goal of complete resection.  Left hemiparesis continues to be significantly improved and patient continues in outpatient *****.  She was also seen by Dr. ***** in Rehab for ***** today.She is currently on 10th month everolimus 
 and ribociclib, tolerating well.      1. Continue ribociclib/everolimus - increase everolimus to 2mg daily due to growth, level, and tolerability; continue ribociclib 200mg a day.   2  ***** discuss everolimus change with Dr. ***** at ***** in ***** who provides local oncologic care to patient  3. Repeat labs prior to each cycle start and if febrile.  4. Continue outpatient PT/OT as planned per Dr. ***** and Dr. ***** ; see his note for detailed recommendations  5. follow up MRI/MRA in 3 months at *****.           I spent a total of 80 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.
