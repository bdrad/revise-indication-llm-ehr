It was a pleasure seeing ***** ***** in Pediatric Rehabilitation Clinic 04/12/2022. ***** was seen by Dr. ***** ***** in clinic today and discussed the following:    Tone management: Plan to increase baclofen to 10mg TID over 1 week.   We once more discussed role of botox injections to forearm muscles - wrist and finger flexors. ***** request authorization for 200 units.  Labs: none  Imaging: none  Bracing: ***** is awaiting a new wrist-hand brace. We discussed the role of this brace for maintaining ROM at *****'s wrist to prevent contracture, and that this is an additive to her regimen of baclofen, and would remain important even if she were to trial botox injections.  I also spoke regarding her walking pattern abnormalities that the current carbon fiber AFO is likely not providing enough support, and increases risk for joint wear and tear over time, but we ultimately decided to continue to monitor this. I discussed that bracing type and needs may fluctuate over time and growth.   DME: no equipment needs  Therapies: ***** continues to benefit from ***** based services. Especially after botox injections.
