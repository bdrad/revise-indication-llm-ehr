UCSF PEDIATRIC NEURO-ONCOLOGY NOTE:     DATE OF VISIT:  04/12/2022     PATIENT ID:  ***** ***** is a 10 y.o. female who presents accompanied by both parents for follow up evaluation of recurrent ependymoma.  No interpreter was utilized.    CHIEF COMPLAINT: left-sided weakness  TREATMENT PROTOCOL: everolimus and ribociclib   DATE OF THERAPY START:  10/10/2021 (everolimus) 10/19/21 (ribociclib)  VISIT: Cycle 6 Day 17  (started 03/27/22)    CC: weakness (improving)    Last visit:01/11/2022      History of Present Illness:  ***** is a now 10 y.o. 8 m.o. female with history of parietal anaplastic ependymoma.  She was first diagnosed in May 2019, after presenting with 1 month of persistent R frontal headaches, double vision, emesis, and ***** weakness. MRI showed a R frontal mass encasing branches of the R MCA, with calcification and vasogenic edema. She underwent uncomplicated subtotal resection at ***** on 05/20/2019 (Dr. *****), with a small residual portion adherent to the ***** branch of the MCA. Pathology was consistent with anaplastic ependymoma; ***** was requested but was denied by insurance even on appeal. ***** subsequently underwent radiation therapy at *****. *****'s in *****, *****, with 59.4Gy over 33 fractions, completed on 08/27/2019. She was then followed by surveillance MRI.     In March 2020, she was noted to have progression of the residual lesion; surgery was planned for 05/11/2020 at *****. However, on May 10, patient developed acute onset distal L side weakness, facial weakness, and dysarthria, and presented to our ED. Code stroke was called, imaging obtained, and Neurology evaluated as most c/w ***** due to tumor progression. ***** to ***** on May 11 with Neurosurgery (Dr/ Sun), Neuro-IR, and Neuro-Vascular surgery, for craniotomy, intraoperative IR angiogram, intraoperative extra-to intracranial-vascular bypass, and tumor resection. Procedure was reportedly without complication but given the involvement of at least 3 
 branches of the MCA, a bypass was not done and it was felt that some disease was likely left behind.  ***** recovered well from surgery and has ***** weakness or numbness with left side.     On 06/15/2020 her interval MRI had improved and so we moved forward with re-irradiation at ***** which she has also completed on 08/03/2020- s/p 35 Gy x 10 fractions + 40 Gy boost to medial enhancing portion. She tolerated RT well with no significant complications, had some mild fatigue and intermittent ***** in R frontal area that was transient and infrequent.      ***** revealed ***** and ***** deletions, ***** mutation, and known ***** fusion. I have previously discussed with *****'s parents that one recent study found that ***** deletion in the setting of *****-fusion + ependymoma was associated with a higher risk of recurrence.  We have also discussed available experimental treatment options.      ***** was enrolled in the ***** Brain Child-01 *****-T trial in January 2021.  She received intra-Ommaya and/or LP treatment weekly for a total of 6 cycles through May 2021.  Follow up MRI on 06/23/21 was concerning for tumor progression and she came off of study.      ***** underwent repeat surgical resection by Dr. ***** on 09/15/21. Complete surgical resection was achieved.  As anticipated, ***** had left hemiparesis after surgery.  She underwent inpatient rehab after recovering from surgery and made excellent progress, although remained weak on her left side distal > proximal. Ongoing PT/OT. Outpatient therapies started. ***** started planned therapy while in the hospital on Apri.4, 2022 and now is taking both everolimus and ribociclib.      INTERVAL HISTORY:  ***** started Cycle 6 ribociclib on 03/27/22 and is on day *****/*****; she continues to take daily everolimus. She has no concerning side effects from either ribociclib or everolimus.  No diarrhea or vomiting. Occasional mouth sores. Her left-sided weakness continues to 
 improve. She has some dysautonomia that will effect the left upper extremity, the arm will get blue and cold. These episodes are intermittent in nature occurring 1-2x per month, they can last several hours, not associated pain.  She goes to OT in *****, ***** every Friday.  She was previously discharged from ***** but she continues OT for fine motor with hand. She denies recent headaches.

Performed using the ***** Architect Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (*****). Method performance characteristics are available from the laboratory upon request.       IMAGING:       I personally reviewed and interpreted MRI below and compared to several priors including most recent.  I reviewed the MRI with the patient's family.  There is decreased resection cavity; no radiographic evidence for tumor recurrence.      MR BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  *****/*****/***** 8:28 AM    INDICATION (as provided by referring clinician): Brain neoplasm (known or suspected)  history of multiply 
 recurrent ependymoma    ADDITIONAL HISTORY: 10 y.o.***** in our office with a history ***** ependymoma. Status post resection with minimal residual tumor adherent to the M2 branch in 2019. Status post radiation August 2019; pre-resection for recurrent March 2020; re-radiation at ***** and *****-T; September 2021 re-resection     COMPARISON: Most recent MRI brain 01/11/2022.    TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences through the brain were acquired at 3.0 tesla.    MEDICATIONS:  Dotarem - 6 mL - Intravenous    FINDINGS:    Compared to 01/11/2022, unchanged appearance of postsurgical change status post right parietal craniotomy for tumor resection and MCA skeletonization with redemonstration of susceptibility foci surrounding the resection cavity, thin linear and minimally nodular enhancement surrounding the resection cavity, as well as T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal surrounding the resection cavity extending into the external capsule, as before.     Artifact related to vascular clip.  No interval change in thin right holohemispheric extra-axial collection/dural thickening. Unchanged ventricular size with ex vacuo dilatation of the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle. No acute hemorrhage. No herniation. No areas of new or reduced diffusion.       IMPRESSION:     Compared to 01/11/2022, no evidence of tumor progression.     Report dictated by: ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** *****, MD  Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging      Assessment/Plan     ***** is a 10 yo F with history of multiply recurrent parietal *****-fusion anaplastic ependymoma.  She underwent repeat tumor resection by Dr. ***** in September 2021 with anticipate left-hemiparesis due to goal of complete resection.  Left hemiparesis continues to be significantly improved  and patient continues in outpatient *****.  She was also seen by Dr. ***** in Rehab for follow up today.She is currently on everolimus and ribociclib, 
 tolerating well , with only mild neutropenia.  She is currently in third cycle.     1. Continue ribociclib/everolimus - no change to daily dose.    2  Schedule visit with Dr. ***** at ***** in ***** at least monthly for next two cycles  3. Repeat labs prior to each cycle start and if febrile.  4. Continue outpatient PT/OT as planned per Dr. *****; see his note for detailed recommendations  5. follow up MRI in 3 months at *****.          I spent a total of 60 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.
