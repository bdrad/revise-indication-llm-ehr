      Subjective    ***** ***** is a 10 y.o. female with diagnosis of recurrent anaplastic ependymoma of parietal lobe s/p multiple resections, most recently November 2021 who was seen on 10/27/2022 at the Pediatric Rehabilitation Clinic at ***** ***** Children's Hospital.     ***** is primarily followed by my colleague, Dr. ***** *****, who last saw her on 06/25/22. She presents today for botox injections which I am performing as Dr. ***** is unavailable.   Please see documentation from visit with Dr. ***** on 06/25/22 for details. At that visit, he had recommended botox 200 units to left forarm muscles (wrist and finger flexors). He had also increased baclofen to 10mg TID, discussed regular use of new left wrist-hand brace, and OT after botox injections.     She is getting an MRI brain later today and has follow-up with Dr. ***** in neuro-onc tomorrow.     Updates:    - Mom notes they have left resting WHO but not using it consistently  - Mom notes they are currently not getting any OT and would need order to restart after botox today.   - Mom notes they are not getting any PT and wanting to restart for concern about balance  - Mom also interested in ***** as noting more drooling.

This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the UCSF Clinical Laboratories.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration.  Performed using the ***** Architect Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (*****). Method performance characteristics are available from the laboratory upon request.         No results found.            PROCEDURE NOTE:      As such we decided to proceed with Botox injections. We are using Botox A with serial number ***** with expiration date of October 2023 at 100 units and serial number ***** at expiration date of February 2024 at 100 *****  1 mL to 100 unit dilation of normal saline without preservatives and a 27-gauge needle. The NDC Code is *****.    Patient has had no fevers in the past 24 hours, had no antibiotics nor received any vaccinations. There are no signs of infection at the planned sites of injections. I talked to the family again about the potential side effects and 
 risks about the injections and they was in support with proceeding with the injections so I proceeded with a total of 180 units. Injection sites were cleaned with alcohol prior to injections. Injection sites were prepped with ethyl chloride prior to injection.       For the upper extremities, I used 70 units in the left FCR, 100 units in the left FDS (at 2 sites), and 10 units in thumb.        The total was 180 units - 20 units was discarded. She had minimal bleeding afterward and I do not anticipate any significant bruising or problems postprocedure, but the family is aware of how to contact us if they have any other concerns.        PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION:  Consent was obtained after discussing risk, benefits and alternatives to injections.    A Timeout was also completed prior to the procedure.  The botulinum toxin type A (100 units per vial) was reconstituted with 0.9% normal saline without preservative to a concentration of 100 units per 1ml (unless otherwise specified). Injection area was marked and cleansed with alcohol.  Selected muscles were localized using anatomic landmarks. Intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin was done using amounts per muscle group listed above.  Aspiration for blood was done prior to each injection.  Patient tolerated this procedure without complication.         Assessment and Plan     ***** ***** is a 10 y.o. female with a history of left parietal recurrent ependymoma, s/p multiple resection most recently 11/28/2021. She has new neurologic impairment of left hemiparesis, spasticity, and functional impairment.     Tolerated botox injections well today as noted above.       ***** ***** had minimal bleeding afterward and I do not anticipate any significant bruising or problems postprocedure, but the family is aware of how to contact us if they have any other concerns.            A small amount of bruising and muscle soreness can be expected   Expect to see relaxation of 
 muscles immediately if they received phenol and in 3-5 days if they received Botox.    Feel free to use appropriate weight based dosing of acetaminophen or motrin according to package instruction or heat or ice for discomfort.   No limitation in daily activity but would not stretch aggressively for the first week.   If you have any concerns such as local redness, fever or other unusual symptoms call the rehabilitation nurse line. *****-*****-*****.   If you have breathing or swallowing concerns seek care immediately.      All other plan as per primary physiatrist, Dr. *****, on 06/25/22 documentation. ***** contact Dr. ***** about PT, OT, and SLP services.  Follow-up as per Dr. *****.              I spent a total of 50 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    ***** *****, MD MSc  Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine
