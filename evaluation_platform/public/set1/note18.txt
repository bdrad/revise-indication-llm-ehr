 in our office with a history ***** ependymoma. Status post resection with minimal residual tumor adherent to the M2 branch in 2019. Status post radiation August 2019; pre-resection for recurrent March 2020; re-radiation at ***** and *****-T; September 2021 re-resection COMPARISON: Most recent MRI brain 01/11/2022. TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences through the brain were acquired at 3.0 tesla. MEDICATIONS: Dotarem - 6 mL - Intravenous FINDINGS: Compared to 01/11/2022, unchanged appearance of postsurgical change status post right craniotomy for tumor resection and MCA skeletonization with redemonstration of susceptibility foci medial to the resection cavity, thin linear and minimally nodular enhancement surrounding the resection cavity, as well as T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal surrounding the resection cavity extending into the external capsule, as before. Artifact related to vascular clip.  No interval change in thin right holohemispheric extra-axial T2/FLAIR hyperintense collection. Unchanged ventricular size with ex vacuo dilatation of the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle. No acute hemorrhage. No herniation. No areas of new or reduced diffusion.     Compared to 01/11/2022, no evidence of tumor progression.        Assessment and Plan     ***** ***** is a 10 y.o. female with a history of left parietal recurrent ependymoma, s/p multiple resection most recently 09/15/2021. She has new neurologic impairment of left hemiparesis, spasticity, and functional impairment.     1. Tone management: Plan to increase baclofen to 10mg TID over 1 week.   1. We once more discussed role of botox injections to forearm muscles - wrist and finger flexors. ***** request authorization for 200 units.  2. Labs: none  3. Imaging: none  4. Bracing: ***** is awaiting a new wrist-hand brace. We discussed the role of this brace for maintaining ROM at *****'s wrist to prevent contracture, and that this is an additive to her regimen of 
 baclofen, and would remain important even if she were to trial botox injections.  I also spoke regarding her walking pattern abnormalities that the current carbon fiber AFO is likely not providing enough support, and increases risk for joint wear and tear over time, but we ultimately decided to continue to monitor this. I discussed that bracing type and needs may fluctuate over time and growth.   5. DME: no equipment needs  6. Therapies: ***** continues to benefit from ***** based services. Especially after botox injections.       7. School: 5054/IEP considerations:  a. For motor and mobility impairment, or pain that limits activity, accommodations should be made for adaptive physical education.   b. For graphomotor issues she should be getting OT and Adaptive technologies, speak to text for these issues   c. Additional considerations include  i. extra time on test  ii. ***** notes   iii. resource access            I spent a total of 55 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures. This time includes time spent with the patient as well as time spent documenting in the medical record, reviewing patient's records and tests, obtaining history, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family, or caregiver, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above.    ***** ***** *****, MD   Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine  04/12/2022
