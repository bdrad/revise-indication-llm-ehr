Hi *****, Not sure if you saw the email thread that ***** has recurrence. We will discuss tomorrow in *****. ***** and ***** weighed in that they think this is a good case for very focused RT. She is also potentially eligible for *****, although if she has only local recurrence, RT likely makes more sense right now.  Can you join *****? *****, please email parents sample consent for *****. I am going to call them after tumor board tumor.  *****, *****
