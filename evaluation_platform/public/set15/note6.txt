OPHTH NEURO OP MB 490 - Progress Notes (Physician) | 2020-12-08 00:00:00
NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY CLINIC    History of Present Illness  ***** ***** ***** is ***** 33 y.o. female who presents for evaluation of an  acute and painless inferior visual field defect left eye onset 11/14/20, now improving on steroids.     This visit 12/08/20, she is starting prednisone 60mg today. Her left eye vision is improving with some color vision. She thinks she can see some red and orange now. She thinks overall she has had 25% improvement in her vision.    Serum lab results ALL negative thus far: ANA <40 (normal), ANCA normal, Lyme negative, ACE (normal), HIV negative, C3 65 (low), C4 13.9 (nl), TB (neg), RPR nonreactive, anti-NMO (neg), anti-***** (neg). From ***** clinic November 24, also additional labs were ordered: Sedimentation Rate 6, CRP <0.2 N, Toxoplasma gondii Antibody, IgG & IgM neg, Bartonella species Antibodies neg, *****'s Antibodies neg, serum protein electrophoresis normal.     Interval History 12/01/20  The patient was taking prednisone 80 mg PO. She is reporting some minor muscle tenderness (as if she has exercised too much) of her thighs right>left as well as mild skin acne. No other side effects of her steroid. Regarding her vision, the patient reports that she notices very small, steady improvement. She now has ***** visual acuity card on her computer which she uses to check her visual acuity of her left eye regularly. Denies any eye pain with eye movements, only the slight "pressure" which has been there since the beginning. She is also reporting mild diplopia in the evening as her vision continues to improve, but it does not really interfere with her ADLs. She also reports that color vision is also improved.     Interval history 11/28/20:  Patient has completed IV solumedrol 1 g x 5 days. Her last dose of IV solumedrol was November 24. Since November 25, she has been on PO prednisone 80 mg x 1 week with plan for slow taper. Pt reports continued, very little, improvement symptoms in the left eye. She reports that she 
 can now discern certain colors (pink, yellow, orange, blue), and able to see cars pass on the street on her left eye. She is also able to see street lights when she could not previously see them. She reports no pain with eye movements, but there is some "pressure," which is the same as before. She has been measuring her fasting blood glucose levels while on prednisone, and they have been <100s.     She reports that there is ***** lot of black mold in ***** ***** and is wondering if this may be causing her symptoms.    Interval history 11/19/20:  Patient reported that her vision remains poor in her left eye. She reported that she still cannot see her hand when she waves it in front her left eye. She reported that her vision has been like this since she left the ED November 16 after her dose of IV solumedrol 500 mg. It has not gotten better or worse since then. She has not yet missed ***** dose of her PO steroids and has been taking PO prednisone 625 mg daily since her discharge from the ED November 16. She continues to report minimal left eye pain with eye movements. She presents to the ED today after discussion over the phone that if her vision did not improve, she would need further evaluation and likely IV solumedrol.    Interval history 11/14/20:  The patient reports that this visual field defect started this morning. She noticed it when she woke up this morning. Denies any trauma or procedures. She reports that starting two days ago, she felt that she had something inside her left eye. She reports that it was slightly blurry. But her vision would clear "every now and then." This has never happened to her before. She denies diplopia. Denies new floaters, flashes of light. Denies eye pain (at rest or with movement), but says that there might be some slight eye pressure in the upper right area of her orbit which she thinks may be related to eye strain. It is very mild, however, and she would not even rate it ***** 1 out of 10 in severity. 
 She denies any photophobia, or headache. Denies eye redness, burning, significant tearing or discharge. Denies recent sick contacts, nasal congestion, sore throat, or cough. Denies any tinnitus or pulsatile tinnitus.    She has ***** past ocular history of myopia, has been wearing eyeglasses since 2007. Her eyeglass prescription is -1.50 OD, -1.75 OS. She has no medical issues.    The patient denies any numbness, weakness, problems with speech, swallowing or difficulties with balance.      ROS  As per HPI, otherwise neg.

COMPARISON: MRI brain/orbits 11/14/2020.  TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences through the orbits were acquired at 3.0 tesla.  CONTRAST MEDIA: Intravenous gadolinium chelate was administered for post-contrast imaging.  FINDINGS:  Asymmetric smaller caliber of the left intraorbital to canalicular optic nerve (series 6 image 13, series 4 image 31) with increased T2 signal (series 8 image 28) and possible subtle enhancement and slight swelling (series 9 image 27-28) as well as mild perineural stranding.  Compared to 11/14/2020, there is interval increase in prominent CSF signal intensity within the left intraorbital optic nerve sheath, best seen on coronal T2 series 8 image 25 ***** ***** ***** series 6 image 13.  Normal caliber and signal of the optic chiasm. Globes appear symmetric in position. Extraocular muscles are normal.   No acute findings in the visualized intracranial contents. Ventricles within normal limits of size for age.  Expected flow voids are maintained.  IMPRESSION:   1. Left optic neuropathy primarily involving the intraorbital left optic nerve.   2. Since 11/14/2020, interval increase in prominent CSF within the left intraorbital optic nerve sheath likely related to adjacent optic neuropathy.  //Impression ***** ***** ***** *****. ***** ***** (Ophthalmology) by ***** *****, MD (Radiology) on *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM.//     Assessment and Plan  ***** ***** ***** is ***** 33 y.o. female previously referred ***** visual field defect left eye. The patient had ***** inferior visual field defect left eye which was acute and painless November 15 
 *****.The neuro-ophthalmic examination on November 15 was significant ***** left eye,dense inferior visual field defect left eye on automated visual field testing, dyschromatopsia. She was admitted to the ED for IV solumedrol 500 mg x1 dose and discharged on PO prednisone 625 mg daily. Following her discharge from the ED November 16, the patient has reported worsened vision left eye. On November 20, her exam is significant for NLP left eye with rAPD left eye and bilateral optic discs with sharp margins, no peripapillary hemorrhages, no cotton wool spots. She was admitted to the hospital for ***** 5-day course of IV solumedrol 1g.    Her presentation is concerning for optic neuritis, ***** atypical given her lack of pain with eye movements and her dense visual field defect which progressed very quickly. Her testing has returned negative for anti-NMO and anti-*****. She is slowly improving following IV solumedrol X 2 and on PO prednisone. Her neuro-ophthalmic examination today is significant for visual acuity improved to 20/400 left eye. Optic discs are normal both eyes. We will continue ***** slow prednisone taper and monitor closely.    Diagnosis/Plan    1. Optic neuritis left eye  - Mild temporal pallor OS  - Continue prednisone 80 mg daily for now  - Continue Esomeprazole 40 mg daily for prophylaxis/Vit D and Ca while on prednisone > 20 mg every day  - Discussion of plasmapheresis or IVIG as ***** possible treatment if she does not continue to improve, risks/benefits extensively discussed  - if vision does not improve, consider IV solumedrol again    RTC 1 week with HVF and April    ***** ***** ***** was instructed to call our office or visit the emergency room with any new symptoms, including worsening vision, pain, redness, swelling, changes in vision, flashes, floaters, blurry vision, or dark ***** over vision.    *****,    ***** *****, MD FRCPC FRCSC  Assistant Professor of Neurology ***** *****  ***** of *****,
