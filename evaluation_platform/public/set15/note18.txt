NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY CLINIC    History of Present Illness  ***** ***** ***** is ***** 33 y.o. female who presents for evaluation of ***** inferior visual field defect left eye.     Since last visit, patient has completed IV solumedrol 1 g x 5 days. Her last dose of IV solumedrol was November 24. Since November 25, she has been on PO prednisone 80 mg x 1 week with plan for slow taper. Pt reports continued, very little, improvement symptoms in the left eye. She reports that she can now discern certain colors (pink, yellow, orange, blue), and able to see cars pass on the street on her left eye. She is also able to see street lights when she could not previously see them. She reports no pain with eye movements, but there is some "pressure," which is the same as before. She has been measuring her fasting blood glucose levels while on prednisone, and they have been <100s.     Lab results: ANA <40 (normal), ANCA normal, Lyme negative, bartonella (quantity not sufficient), ACE (normal), HIV negative, C3 65 (low), C4 13.9 (nl), TB (neg), RPR nonreactive, anti-NMO (neg), anti-***** (neg)    She was seen in ***** clinic November 24. Additional labs were ordered: Sedimentation Rate, Toxoplasma gondii Antibody, IgG & IgM, Bartonella species Antibodies, *****'s Antibodies. Labs have not yet been drawn.    She reports that there is ***** lot of black mold in ***** ***** and is wondering if this may be causing her symptoms.    Interval history 11/19/20:  Patient reported that her vision remains poor in her left eye. She reported that she still cannot see her hand when she waves it in front her left eye. She reported that her vision has been like this since she left the ED November 16 after her dose of IV solumedrol 500 mg. It has not gotten better or worse since then. She has not yet missed ***** dose of her PO steroids and has been taking PO prednisone 625 mg daily since her discharge from the ED November 16. She continues to report minimal left eye pain with eye movements. She 
 presents to the ED today after discussion over the phone that if her vision did not improve, she would need further evaluation and likely IV solumedrol.    Interval history 11/14/20:  The patient reports that this visual field defect started this morning. She noticed it when she woke up this morning. Denies any trauma or procedures. She reports that starting two days ago, she felt that she had something inside her left eye. She reports that it was slightly blurry. But her vision would clear "every now and then." This has never happened to her before. She denies diplopia. Denies new floaters, flashes of light. Denies eye pain (at rest or with movement), but says that there might be some slight eye pressure in the upper right area of her orbit which she thinks may be related to eye strain. It is very mild, however, and she would not even rate it ***** 1 out of 10 in severity. She denies any photophobia, or headache. Denies eye redness, burning, significant tearing or discharge. Denies recent sick contacts, nasal congestion, sore throat, or cough. Denies any tinnitus or pulsatile tinnitus.    She has ***** past ocular history of myopia, has been wearing eyeglasses since 2007. Her eyeglass prescription is -1.50 OD, -1.75 OS. She has no medical issues.

Optic chiasm and right optic nerve normal in signal and caliber. Globes and extraocular muscles normal in appearance bilaterally. No orbital mass or inflammatory fat stranding.    Minimal focal encephalomalacia along the left inferior frontal gyrus likely reflecting sequela of remote trauma (axial FLAIR series 800, images 75-76). Brain parenchyma otherwise normal in signal intensity and morphology for age. No suspicious parenchymal T2 hyperintensity. No reduced diffusion or abnormal susceptibility. No abnormal parenchymal, leptomeningeal, or dural enhancement.    Ventricles within normal limits of size for age.  No extra-axial collection.    IMPRESSION:     Subtle enhancement along the left intracanalicular optic nerve 
 consistent with early optic neuritis.      Assessment and Plan  ***** ***** ***** is ***** 33 y.o. female previously referred ***** visual field defect left eye. The patient had ***** inferior visual field defect left eye which was acute and painless November 15 *****.The neuro-ophthalmic examination on November 15 was significant ***** left eye,dense inferior visual field defect left eye on automated visual field testing, dyschromatopsia. She was admitted to the ED for IV solumedrol 500 mg x1 dose and discharged on PO prednisone 625 mg daily. Following her discharge from the ED November 16, the patient has reported worsened vision left eye. On November 20, her exam is significant for NLP left eye with rAPD left eye and bilateral optic discs with sharp margins, no peripapillary hemorrhages, no cotton wool spots. She was admitted to the hospital for ***** 5-day course of IV solumedrol 1g.    Her presentation is concerning for optic neuritis, ***** atypical given her lack of pain with eye movements and her significant worsening very quickly to NLP vision. It is promising that she continues to respond with PO steroids.     Diagnosis/Plan    1. Optic neuritis left eye  - Continue slow PO prednisone taper: 80 mg x 2 weeks, then 60 mg x 2 weeks  - Continue esomeprazole 40 mg daily for prophylaxis  - Labs ordered: serum protein electrophoresis, CBC, CMP    RTC December 02 for follow-up      ***** ***** ***** was instructed to call our office or visit the emergency room with any new symptoms, including worsening vision, pain, redness, swelling, changes in vision, flashes, floaters, blurry vision, or dark ***** over vision.    *****,        ***** *****, MD, PhD  UCSF Ophthalmology PGY-2    *****Patient discussed with the attending physician, ***** *****, but not seen by attending
