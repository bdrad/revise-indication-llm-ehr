OPHTH NEURO OP MB 490 - Progress Notes (Physician) | 2020-12-01 00:00:00
NEURO-OPHTHALMOLOGY CLINIC    History of Present Illness  ***** ***** ***** is ***** 33 y.o. female who presents for evaluation of ***** inferior visual field defect left eye. Referred from the ED.    Since last visit, the patient is taking prednisone 80 mg PO. She is reporting some minor muscle tenderness (as if she has exercised too much) of her thighs right>left as well as mild skin acne. No other side effects of her steroid. Regarding her vision, the patient reports that she notices very small, steady improvement. She now has ***** visual acuity card on her computer which she uses to check her visual acuity of her left eye regularly. Denies any eye pain with eye movements, only the slight "pressure" which has been there since the beginning. She is also reporting mild diplopia in the evening as her vision continues to improve, but it does not really interfere with her ADLs. She also reports that color vision is also improved. She obtained her labs: Toxo neg, CRP <0.2 N, ESR 6 N, serum protein electrophoresis normal.   Pending work-up: Bartonella Ab, *****'s Ab, NMO Ab, ***** Ab.     Interval history 11/28/20:  Patient has completed IV solumedrol 1 g x 5 days. Her last dose of IV solumedrol was November 24. Since November 25, she has been on PO prednisone 80 mg x 1 week with plan for slow taper. Pt reports continued, very little, improvement symptoms in the left eye. She reports that she can now discern certain colors (pink, yellow, orange, blue), and able to see cars pass on the street on her left eye. She is also able to see street lights when she could not previously see them. She reports no pain with eye movements, but there is some "pressure," which is the same as before. She has been measuring her fasting blood glucose levels while on prednisone, and they have been <100s.     Lab results: ANA <40 (normal), ANCA normal, Lyme negative, bartonella (quantity not sufficient), ACE (normal), HIV negative, C3 65 (low), C4 13.9 (nl), TB 
 (neg), RPR nonreactive, anti-NMO (neg), anti-***** (neg)    She was seen in ***** clinic November 24. Additional labs were ordered: Sedimentation Rate, Toxoplasma gondii Antibody, IgG & IgM, Bartonella species Antibodies, *****'s Antibodies. Labs have not yet been drawn.    She reports that there is ***** lot of black mold in ***** ***** and is wondering if this may be causing her symptoms.    Interval history 11/19/20:  Patient reported that her vision remains poor in her left eye. She reported that she still cannot see her hand when she waves it in front her left eye. She reported that her vision has been like this since she left the ED November 16 after her dose of IV solumedrol 500 mg. It has not gotten better or worse since then. She has not yet missed ***** dose of her PO steroids and has been taking PO prednisone 625 mg daily since her discharge from the ED November 16. She continues to report minimal left eye pain with eye movements. She presents to the ED today after discussion over the phone that if her vision did not improve, she would need further evaluation and likely IV solumedrol.    Interval history 11/14/20:  The patient reports that this visual field defect started this morning. She noticed it when she woke up this morning. Denies any trauma or procedures. She reports that starting two days ago, she felt that she had something inside her left eye. She reports that it was slightly blurry. But her vision would clear "every now and then." This has never happened to her before. She denies diplopia. Denies new floaters, flashes of light. Denies eye pain (at rest or with movement), but says that there might be some slight eye pressure in the upper right area of her orbit which she thinks may be related to eye strain. It is very mild, however, and she would not even rate it ***** 1 out of 10 in severity. She denies any photophobia, or headache. Denies eye redness, burning, significant tearing or discharge. Denies recent sick contacts, nasal 
 congestion, sore throat, or cough. Denies any tinnitus or pulsatile tinnitus.    She has ***** past ocular history of myopia, has been wearing eyeglasses since 2007. Her eyeglass prescription is -1.50 OD, -1.75 OS. She has no medical issues.    The patient denies any numbness, weakness, problems with speech, swallowing or difficulties with balance.

 Contrast    Result Date: 12/12/2020  ***** ORBIT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  *****/*****/***** 8:24 AM INDICATION (as provided by referring clinician): optic neuritis, assess for interval change ADDITIONAL HISTORY: Left eye pain beginning 11/12/2020, left inferior field cut with partial involvement of the superior field, lack of eye pain with movements. No evidence of CNS demyelination COMPARISON: 11/19/2020 TECHNIQUE: Multiple sequences through the orbits were acquired at 3.0 tesla. CONTRAST MEDIA: Intravenous gadolinium chelate was administered for post-contrast imaging. FINDINGS: Mild motion degradation partially limits evaluation. Similar to slightly decreased subtle intraorbital left optic nerve enhancement and T2 hyperintensity without definitive adjacent perineural stranding. Similar prominent CSF within the optic nerve sheath. Right optic nerve is benign-appearing. Globes are unremarkable. Symmetric extraocular musculature. Visualized intracranial contents are unremarkable.     Evaluation is mildly limited by motion artifact across multiple sequences. Compared with 11/19/2020, similar to slightly decreased conspicuity of imaging findings associated with the left intraorbital optic nerve. Report dictated by: ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** *****, MD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging      Assessment and Plan  ***** ***** ***** is ***** 33 y.o. female previously referred ***** visual field defect left eye. The patient had ***** inferior visual field defect left eye which was acute and painless November 15 *****.The neuro-ophthalmic examination on November 15 was significant ***** left eye,dense inferior visual field defect left eye on automated visual field testing, dyschromatopsia. She was admitted to the ED for IV solumedrol 500 mg x1 dose and discharged on PO prednisone 625 mg daily. Following her discharge from the ED November 16, the patient has reported worsened vision left eye. On November 20, her exam is significant for NLP left 
 eye with rAPD left eye and bilateral optic discs with sharp margins, no peripapillary hemorrhages, no cotton wool spots. She was admitted to the hospital for ***** 5-day course of IV solumedrol 1g.    Her presentation is concerning for optic neuritis, ***** atypical given her lack of pain with eye movements and her dense visual field defect. Her testing has returned negative for anti-NMO and anti-*****. She is slowly improving following IV solumedrol and on PO prednisone. Her neuro-ophthalmic examination today is significant for visual acuity improved to 20/600 left eye. Optic discs are normal both eyes. We will continue ***** slow prednisone taper and monitor closely.    Diagnosis/Plan    1. Optic neuritis left eye  - Continue slow PO prednisone taper: 80 mg x 2 weeks, then 60 mg x 2 weeks  - Continue esomeprazole 40 mg daily for prophylaxis    RTC December 09 for follow-up      ***** ***** ***** was instructed to call our office or visit the emergency room with any new symptoms, including worsening vision, pain, redness, swelling, changes in vision, flashes, floaters, blurry vision, or dark ***** over vision.    *****,      ***** *****, MD, PhD  UCSF Ophthalmology PGY-2
