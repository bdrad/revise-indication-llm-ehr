Neurological Clinical Summary:   63-year-old right-handed man with progressive MS (SP MS, new lesions on spine MRI 2017 versus 2015), on ocrelizumab. First symptom age 29 with foot numbness that resolved. Diagnosed with MS at age 32. He had about 10 ***** in the early few years, then started taking Betaseron in 1992 and had no ***** since then. He has had insidious worsening of gait, started using a cane about 16 years ago, fell and broke right hip ago 2003. Walks with 2 *****. He also has severe bladder dysfunction, self-catheterization-dependent for about 17 years. Bowel regimen for about 18 years. He has taken multiple medications for spasticity including Botox, diazepam, baclofen. He tried 4-AP for gait.   Ocrelizumab started April 2017, redosed October 2018 and May 2018. Ocrelizumab was discontinued as it was associated with increased severity of urinary tract infections, leading on one occasion to hospitalization for IV antibiotics. Started ***** June 2019, stopped July 2019 out of concern for increased ***** risk and has been off since then.   --spasticity in *****: takes baclofen 10 mg QPM; "I would rather be spastic than drowsy", has taken *****, valium, ativan, had botox before.

MRI brain and spine to evaluate disease progression vs other cause of worsening gait/balance, currently scheduled  5. Follow-up in 4-6 months, sooner as needed for worsening symptoms    Labs ordered:   Orders Placed This Encounter   Procedures    One-***** Liver Function Panel (T.Bili, Alk Phos, ALT, AST)    Complete Blood Count with Differential    Varicella zoster antibody, IgG     Imaging orders placed: No orders of the defined types were placed in this encounter.    I recommended that the patient 
 return for a follow-up evaluation in 4-6 months. I provided the patient with my contact information should he have any questions or concerns in the interim.     I spent more than 45 minutes face-to-face with the patient and more than half of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks and therapeutic options     Dr ***** was present for face to face with patient and agrees with my assessment and plan    ***** *****, MD PhD  Fellow in *****  UCSF Neurology  04/13/20
