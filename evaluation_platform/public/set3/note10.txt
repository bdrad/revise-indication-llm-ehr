Compared to 04/15/2023, overall similar size of a focal enhancing nodule in the 
 posterior left frontal white matter deep to the precentral gyrus measuring 1.0 x 0.9 cm (axial); previously 1.0 x 1.0 cm when retrospectively measured with similar technique on 04/15/2023. Similar linear and nodular enhancement extending to the ependymal surface of the left lateral ventricle. Decreased pial enhancement overlying the enhancing nodule in the left superior parietal lobule.      Similar extensive FLAIR signal abnormality surrounding the resection cavity and extending throughout the left posterior frontal and parietal lobe.     No acute hemorrhage. No herniation. Ventricles within normal limits of size for age.  No extra-axial collection. Left maxillary sinus mucus retention cyst.     IMPRESSION:      1. No acute intracranial abnormality; specifically, no acute large territorial infarct.      2. No evidence for disease progression since 04/15/2023 with decreased enhancement in the left superior parietal lobule. Grossly similar edema in the left posterior frontal and parietal lobes and similar focal enhancing nodule in the posterior left frontal white matter.      DATA:  Tumor board review: n/a      ASSESSMENT:  The patient has recurrent Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma s/p re-op on 04/25/2020 and then treated with radiation with ***** but opted out of adjuvant *****.   He has had 4 cycles of Avastin (last in December 2022). Recently he was in ED for likely seizure on May 13 and imaging in ED showed no progression of disease. Neurologically he is stable.     Management choices:  1) continue active surveillance; Next MRI on 06/02/23     RECOMMENDATIONS:  1) continue Keppra  2) Maintain all medications as currently prescribed   3) Continue physical and occupational therapy for his right sided weakness   4) Continue following with Neuropsych for cognitive behavioral therapy and evaluation.     - All questions of ***** ***** ***** and his family were answered to the best of my ability.
