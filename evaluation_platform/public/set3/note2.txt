 perfusion. Continued increase in linear and nodular enhancement within the superficial left parietal lobe at the margins of the resection cavity and extending to the ependymal surface of the left lateral ventricle, with redemonstrated focal reduced diffusion adjacent to the left lateral ventricle. Report dictated by: ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** *****, MD, PhD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging    MR Brain with and without Contrast    Result Date: 11/12/2022  Impression 1.

He has had 4 cycles of Avastin (last in December 2022). Recently he was in ED for likely seizure on May 13 and imaging in ED showed no progression of disease. MRI imaging today shows stable but extensive scar tissue on FLAIR. Future potential surgery discussion vs ***** vs another dose of Avastin. Neurologically he continues to be focal with significant R sided motor weakness (weakness is greater in upper extremities compared to the lowers)    We extensively discussed options below:  1) Surgery  2) *****  3) Avastin      RECOMMENDATIONS:  1) continue Keppra, Added Ativan today given recent event of aura while on Keppra (instructed to inform our team when taking keppra)   2) continue R side strength ROM exercises   3) Maintain all medications as currently prescribed   4) Continue physical and occupational therapy for his right sided weakness   5) Continue following with Neuropsych for cognitive behavioral therapy and evaluation.   6) follow up in 6-8 weeks with MRI    - All questions of ***** ***** ***** and his family were answered to the best of my ability. They have our contact information and will call with further questions.     CARE COORDINATION:  Medical updates were sent to each member listed in the patient's care team:    MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:  The above assessment was reviewed in detail with the patient/caregivers. The nature and purpose of each component of the recommendation/plan was discussed in full detail including a review of the likelihood of possible associated benefits, risks, alternatives, and complications. We also reviewed the 
 importance of a balanced diet, appropriate exercise, stress reduction methods, good sleep hygiene, and quality of life measures.    In addition, an After Visit Summary with follow up plan was prepared and reviewed with the patient and sent to the patient's Mychart portal. All questions of the patient and caregivers were answered to the best of my ability. They have our contact information and will call with further questions    TIME:  On the day of the patient's visit, ***** spent a total of 72  minutes in face-to-face time with the patient and in non-face-to-face activities directly related to this visit, including reviewing records and tests, obtaining history and exam, placing orders, communicating with other healthcare professionals, counseling the patient, family or caregiver, documenting in the medical record, and/or care coordination for the diagnoses above. In addition, an After Visit Summary with follow up plan was prepared and reviewed with the patient and sent to the patient's Mychart portal. All questions of the patient and caregivers were answered to the best of my ability. The patient has Neuro-Oncology's contact information and will call with further questions.     *****, ***** ***** am acting as a scribe for services provided by ***** *****. *****, MD on *****/*****/*****  10:49 AM.
